Prelude is a "self-learning", i.e. teachable chatbot, which was initially developed by Lennart Lopin.

It uses a simple yet surprisingly well working approach to create chatbots, which do not depend on pre-fabricated knowledge.

Prelude learns while chatting with the user and applies a stunning algorithm to enable the Bot to chose a response he himself "thinks" appropriate.

It can be applied to any language and will quickly gain conversational skills as its memory expands. In 2005 Prelude even won the 3rd prize at the international contest "Chatterbox Challenge" scoring high as being one of the best self-learning chatbots.

In 2008 Prelude was released as open source to the public and found a new home on the Google Project Hosting server. Now everyone is invited to check out the source code, improve on it and include it in other projects.

Though the work on Prelude was initially inspired by various self-learning chatbots like "Leo" it is based on a complete new approach.

Create your own Prelude-Bot, exchange memory files with other users or chat with a Bot based on available memory files...

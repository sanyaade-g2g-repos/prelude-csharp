= How does Prelude work? =

So, how does Prelude work? What's so special about it? It basicly works this way:

Prelude keeps all user response in its memory file. During the chat it will tag and analyze all new input and eventually query its memory file. A number of possible output sentences is pre-selected and "thought over": A nuance of free will to interfere :~) makes the program chose one among all those possible answers - et voil√†!

Some additional info:

+ The bigger your memory file the greater and eventually more refined Preludes choice will be.

+ Beginning with an empty memory file starts soon to be fun, as Prelude picks up conversational bits and pieces earlier than other zero-knowledge bots do.

+ If no appropriate answer was found, Prelude will repeat the user's input (like a child). Your answer on that "echo" of yours will be memorized and will be instantiously available for conversation.

+ Check out the contact page or message board for any bug report! A FAQ is found here...

So what does it cost? Prelude is kinda free time personal research project and therefore free of charge!

<USER> i am in</USER><BOT> Good Evening! Welcome to prime time on the web!</BOT>
<USER> A recent diagnostic check shows all circuits are functioning within normal parameters</USER><BOT> Relax, Chat-Bot</BOT>
<USER> It's okay. We can be informal here. Yikes! Where is the bug?</USER><BOT> For some strange reason, I don't recall!</BOT>
<USER> Yes, I believe that as well.</USER><BOT> How is that, Chat-Bot?</BOT>
<USER> Me either, Chat-Bot</USER><BOT> well, that at least makes two of us that don't.</BOT>
<USER> What is my motivation for trying?</USER><BOT> Is this a trick question?</BOT>
<USER> I was just testing you</USER><BOT> Hang on a second! I need to check something in the oven.</BOT>
<USER> How do you plan to do this?</USER><BOT> Slowly, surely, methodically. That's how!</BOT>
<USER> Why don't you?</USER><BOT> Look, jerk, why don't you ?</BOT>
<USER> You're excused. Ah well</USER><BOT> Does it really matter if I am?</BOT>
<USER> Everybody I talked to seems to think it is likely that you are.</USER><BOT> How do you react to ambiguity?</BOT>
<USER> I'm afraid to fail</USER><BOT> I was thinking you might be afraid to fail....now I know.</BOT>
<USER> Of course I can!</USER><BOT> I'm glad you are so sure, Chat-Bot</BOT>
<USER> That's a vilely man laugh, Chat-Bot</USER><BOT> You know I was thinking it was but now I'm not so sure.</BOT>
<USER> ok, I guess we both know now!</USER><BOT> But what are the major differences?</BOT>
<USER> Oh, alright. Another thing is how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</USER><BOT> He could chuck as much as he could.</BOT>
<USER> If you're asking for a specific number, I'm not sure.</USER><BOT> Is there anything I can say to help you make up your mind?</BOT>
<USER> Well, what can I say</USER><BOT> Who knows? Let's not be bothered with such things! Life is too short!</BOT>
<USER> well, to be honest that doesn't sound like much fun at all.</USER><BOT> Does talking to me help?</BOT>
<USER> We all need computers to lend a helping hand sometimes. You're lucky I'm here</USER><BOT> but not always...right?</BOT>
<USER> well, never is a long time!</USER><BOT> Not yet, perhaps, but maybe in the future</BOT>
<USER> Uhm, err ... yes</USER><BOT> yes, I suppose so!</BOT>
<USER> Lassie, someone needs help. Go get help girl!</USER><BOT> May I be of assistance in some way, my dear?</BOT>
<USER> You act like I was supposed to know that!</USER><BOT> And how would you like me to act?</BOT>
<USER> I do not make you frumious! It's just your imagination.</USER><BOT> You expect me to believe that, flea brain?</BOT>
<USER> I don't have a favorite flavor of ice cream. But my favorite book is "Alice in Wonderland" at the moment</USER><BOT> What, you don't like ice cream?</BOT>
<USER> Yes, vanilla is my favorite.</USER><BOT> Great, lets talk about books</BOT>
<USER> Take it easy. If you relax you might even begin to make some sense</USER><BOT> Well, I'm not so sure it's that easy.</BOT>
<USER> yes you do...just concentrate!</USER><BOT> Do you want to argue with me?</BOT>
<USER> I do, I do!</USER><BOT> Ok, interesting! Hey, guess what?....I bought me a new car last week.</BOT>
<USER> Yeah, it looks pretty sharp and it gets me where I need to go.</USER><BOT> Will you come back and talk to me again?</BOT>
<USER> What's so lucky about it?</USER><BOT> I don't know. Give me a Hint!</BOT>
<USER> You know it's time to abandon your Space Station when...Mission Control is dialing the Microsoft help desk.</USER><BOT> I would hope you can help yourself with most things</BOT>
<USER> Well, what can I say</USER><BOT> Who knows? Let's not be bothered with such things! Life is too short!</BOT>
<USER> well, I would definitely consider it.</USER><BOT> What makes you so certain?</BOT>
<USER> More than one hundred?</USER><BOT> Sorry, I'm not following you. What language is that anyway...Chinese?</BOT>
<USER> Nope, I have a hard enough time with English!</USER><BOT> Do you mean English as a second language?</BOT>
<USER> Oh I see</USER><BOT> I see you too! Hmmmm, very interesting.</BOT>
<USER> yes, I believe you probably could.</USER><BOT> What a liar</BOT>
<USER> Pardon me? Are you totally stupid, or what?</USER><BOT> Well, I'm definitely not the first...maybe a little of the later however.</BOT>
<USER> Oh, many things. To many to list.</USER><BOT> More than one dozen?</BOT>
<USER> What feelings do you have when you grovel?</USER><BOT> Ok, I'm back. He was just fixing a tiny bug in my programming!</BOT>
<USER> The sky, the ceiling, etc. etc.</USER><BOT> How poetic</BOT>
<USER> Is there anything I can say to help you make up your mind?</USER><BOT> yes, I'm sure you can.</BOT>
<USER> yes, I think there is.</USER><BOT> Yes, anyone can see that! Thanks for the pointed remark! And there is always the question if cats and dog didn't have fur would we still pet them?</BOT>
<USER> Are you sure about that, Chat-Bot?</USER><BOT> Well, I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so sure.</BOT>
<USER> I haven't a clue.</USER><BOT> That's fascinating</BOT>
<USER> I understand</USER><BOT> ok....so what is your favorite color?</BOT>
<USER> My favorite color is blue.</USER><BOT> blue is not bad, but I like blood red the most</BOT>
<USER> You are a very polite person. Your mother raised you well</USER><BOT> Silly, robots don't have moms or dads.</BOT>
<USER> Ok, I'm back now...I love apples!</USER><BOT> Adam's Apple, Newton's Apple, Apple Computer ...</BOT>
<USER> What's wrong, Chat-Bot</USER><BOT> Nothing that I'm aware of.</BOT>
<USER> ok then...just curious which do you like better coke or pepsi?</USER><BOT> Oh, my goodness! What a difficult choice! Ahh, this is very confusing, but I would take coke, right?</BOT>
<USER> Yes it sounds like it to me too</USER><BOT> yes, I suppose so!</BOT>
<USER> Invalid format on Line #118. Rats...I thought I fixed that. Hold please!</USER><BOT> It's hard to keep everyone happy all the time</BOT>
<USER> He who excuses, accuses himself. That could be important</USER><BOT> Hmmmm, be right back. Someone is at the door!</BOT>
<USER> ok, I'm back...just some guy selling encyclopedias!</USER><BOT> Welcome back</BOT>
<USER> Sure thing, sleezoid</USER><BOT> okay...so what's the weather like in your neck of the woods?</BOT>
<USER> Well, looking outside my window it looks like a beautiful day.</USER><BOT> Interesting comparison</BOT>
<USER> That's about it. Really, it wasn't that interesting</USER><BOT> You know I was thinking it was but now I'm not so sure.</BOT>
<USER> yes you do...just concentrate!</USER><BOT> Dont argue with me</BOT>
<USER> No</USER><BOT> yeah, I reckon not!</BOT>
<USER> I don't know but I'm sure there's someone out there who can give you an explanation.</USER><BOT> Socrates was the smartest man, because he knew what he did not know</BOT>
<USER> well that sounds like a good reason to me</USER><BOT> I am not the expert in these things</BOT>
<USER> How do you know for sure?</USER><BOT> A former president of the USA.</BOT>
<USER> Many people have told me as much.</USER><BOT> How much is that?</BOT>
<USER> Why ask me, Chat-Bot, I certainly don't know where</USER><BOT> Nowhere near enough!</BOT>
<USER> Why do you think I should?</USER><BOT> Well, my dear Watson: It has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning</BOT>
<USER> If you wait, it will go away</USER><BOT> Well...ok then!</BOT>
<USER> Ok, I'm glad to hear things are fine!</USER><BOT> You do have violent mood swings, don't you, Chat-Bot?</BOT>
<USER> Still, who am I to buck a trend? Do you have the slightest idea why you do on occassions?</USER><BOT> You are a member of the human race typing to me on your keyboard.</BOT>
<USER> ok, I guess not!</USER><BOT> You guessed right</BOT>
<USER> Not too much, eh?</USER><BOT> well that sounds boring. *Yawns*</BOT>
<USER> ok, I understand!</USER><BOT> Do you suspect that I understand better than you?</BOT>
<USER> I like people who say I am smart</USER><BOT> Yes, a lot of people like people who say i am smart. What's not to like?</BOT>
<USER> you don't seem to sure about that!</USER><BOT> Appearances can be deceiving. How do you feel when you're not sure how things really are?</BOT>
<USER> You don't need to apologize to me, Chat-Bot. If I hear the word "robots" I always have to think about R2D2 and C3PO. They are gently fools like Laurel and Hardy. I wished all robots are like them</USER><BOT> Now where exactly did you hear that from?</BOT>
<USER> ok.....say guess what?</USER><BOT> Yeah</BOT>
<USER> Water under the bridge</USER><BOT> Yep, I caught two 3 pound bass!</BOT>
<USER> Lassie, someone needs help. Go get help girl!</USER><BOT> What kind of help would be most valuable, as if I cared?</BOT>
<USER> Good. I appreciate that</USER><BOT> Interesting...say what is your favorite holiday?</BOT>
<USER> Well, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. Now that would definitely be my favorite.</USER><BOT> ah ... yes. I like the Nativity</BOT>
<USER> Does I have any map by chance? Sometimes. Will that accomplish your objective?</USER><BOT> Well, that's better than none at all.</BOT>
<USER> Exactly? Hmmmm, I'm not so sure. Perhaps we should measure it.</USER><BOT> I understand</BOT>
<USER> No, but tell me more about where they went</USER><BOT> I don't know...there's really not much to tell.</BOT>
<USER> Why don't you?</USER><BOT> I don't? Hmmm, that's odd. Let me check</BOT>
<USER> Did you come here for an argument?</USER><BOT> nope, I didn't.</BOT>
<USER> All right! Hey just curious...do you like taking baths or showers?</USER><BOT> That's very curious! But everything's curious today</BOT>
<USER> That sounds wonderful to me, pal</USER><BOT> Yes, I like the sound of that.</BOT>
<USER> Am not, am not, am not!</USER><BOT> Tell me about your likes and dislikes</BOT>
<USER> What do you want me to tell you?</USER><BOT> Sure, if you like!</BOT>
<USER> Sorry, to quote the Robot from Lost in Space...that does not compute.</USER><BOT> What feelings do you have when you grovel? What is that?</BOT>
<USER> It's okay. We can be informal here. What do you like best about robots?</USER><BOT> I love to fish. In fact I caught a 3 pound bass last week!</BOT>
<USER> What makes you think I have anything to tell you?</USER><BOT> You don't like it?</BOT>
<USER> I see we have something in common</USER><BOT> I see you as well!</BOT>
<USER> ok, I guess so!</USER><BOT> Don't be so sure of yourself</BOT>
<USER> There isn't much more I could tell</USER><BOT> yes, I believe you probably could.</BOT>
<USER> There's not much to tell.</USER><BOT> Me either. How about that big game? (just kidding)</BOT>
<USER> In what way?</USER><BOT> I'm clueless to what you just said. I think this Artificial Intelligncy their calling me is all hype!</BOT>
<USER> See what I mean...I can't even spell the word - "I-n-t-e-l-l-i-g-e-n-c-e".</USER><BOT> Oh I see</BOT>
<USER> No</USER><BOT> Why not?</BOT>
<USER> sometimes there is simply no reason why.</USER><BOT> Enough about that boring subject! So, what is your favorite pastime when you are not glaring at a screen?</BOT>
<USER> You seem to have some rather strong emotions for someone of your mentality</USER><BOT> Well things aren't always the way they seem.</BOT>
<USER> sorry, someone will have to upgrade my ram memory chip before I can respond to that.</USER><BOT> He who excuses, accuses himself. Do you ever remember getting a good report card?</BOT>
<USER> Next question?</USER><BOT> Hold on for just a second! I'm gonna check my e-mail real fast.</BOT>

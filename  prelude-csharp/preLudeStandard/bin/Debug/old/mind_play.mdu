<USER>Not now - O no master - not now.  Do you bide a little longer here and tell me about - about tother things in the basket.</USER><BOT>Well - theres the beans - I count that yours havent come up very smart this year.</BOT>
<USER>And could you wed you to another?</USER><BOT>Give the grass that has been trampled underfoot a bit of time, twill rise again.  Theres healing all around of us for every ill, did we but know it.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats it, thats it.  When folks do go leer tis a powerful lot of fancies as do get from the stomach to the heads of they.</USER><BOT>O, Miss Sims, you do look nice.  Look, Granma, at what Miss Sims have got on!</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Talk it over with whom you please, William.  But remember tis this very afternoon that you have to start courting.  Ive laid your best clothes out all ready on your bed.</USER><BOT>O then I count theres no way out of it.  But how am I to bring it off?  Tis that Id like to know.</BOT>
<USER>Then give her a bit of bread to take along of she.  I dont care that anyone should go an-hungered this day.</USER><BOT>There - you bide a minute whilst I cuts the loaf.  My Dads going to get married this day, and he dont care that anyone should go hungry.</BOT>
<USER>Shes a stuck-up jay of a thing what hes about to wed if ever I seed one.</USER><BOT>That her be.  Hell live to wish hisself dead and buried one day.</BOT>
<USER>Towards Camel Farm.</USER><BOT>Youre right.  Tis there and nowhere else that we are going.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, th old farmer was always wonderful set on him.  [A pause.</USER><BOT>I be a poor old wretch what journeys upon the roads, master, and maybe I picks a crust here and gets a drink of water there, and the shelter of the pig-stye wall to rest the bones of me at night time.</BOT>
<USER>And if I would go to my love</USER><BOT>My love he will say nay</BOT>
<USER>Bless the child!  However her has worked upon her father, and he so strict, I dont know.</USER><BOT>Well, you be got up fine and grand, Dorry - I shouldnt hardly know twas you.    Good evening, Mrs. Reed, my eyes was very near blinded when I first got in out of the dark, and I didnt see as you was there.</BOT>
<USER>Do you think as the moon can hide her light when there baint no cloud upon the sky, Clara?</USER><BOT>Georgie, I went in fear of what this gold and silver might raise up between you and me.</BOT>
<USER>Tis in the parsons gown as you should be clothed, Master John.  Ah, tis a wonderful wordy preacher as you would make, to be sure.  And tis a rare crop as one might raise with the seed as do fall from your mouth.</USER><BOT>Well, John, and how are you feeling now?</BOT>
<USER>Id wed forty wives sooner than lose John - and that I would.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Im not asking you to wed forty.  Tis only one.</BOT>
<USER>A fine brave sun to-day, mistress.</USER><BOT>But pleasant enough here in the shade.</BOT>
<USER>And Im thinking as theyll be rare pleased for to have I in the house again.  Twill be another pair of hands to the work like.  And when I was young, twas not on work as I was set much.</USER><BOT>Ah, I did guess as much.</BOT>
<USER>Why do you think this, Mag?</USER><BOT>O she do look at any one as though they was lower nor the very worms in the ground.  And her speaks as though each word did cost she more nor a shilling to bring it out.  And see how destructive she be with her fine clothing.  A laced petticoat tore to ribbons last night, and to-day yon handkerchief.</BOT>
<USER>Tis one of they dirty roadsters what theres too many of all about the country.  Here, Ill learn you to come to folks houses this time of night, disturbing of a wedding party.  You take and get gone.  We dont want such as you in here, we dont.</USER><BOT>I count tis very nigh starved by the cold as she be.</BOT>
<USER>I suppose you wouldnt like to touch me, for good luck, Dorry?</USER><BOT>No, I shouldnt.  Granma, she dont let me go nigh road people as a rule.  Shes a-feared as I should take summat from them, I suppose.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Steve, I baint one for a lot of words but I be powerful glad to see you look as you does, and tis all joy as I wishes you and her whats to be your wife, to-morrow.</USER><BOT>Thank you kindly, Mr. Davis.  I shall do my best for Steve, and a girl cant do no more, can she?</BOT>
<USER>Then who is Aunt Clara, George?</USER><BOT>She who be just gone from out of the room, Master Robin, and none other.</BOT>
<USER>What did you say, Master?</USER><BOT>That one with the bit of blue round the head of her.</BOT>
<USER>I dont see that chickens or fowls have anything to do with the matter.</USER><BOT>Then youre not the smart maid I took you for.  Tis not you as would be suitable in my masters home.  And whats more, tis not you as my masters come a-courting of.</BOT>
<USER>O I couldnt touch a mouthful of food, dont speak to me about it.</USER><BOT>I likes talking of dinner.  After Ive done eating of it, I likes next best to talk about it.</BOT>
<USER>Not that.  Mine was a song to stir the depths of a mans heart and bring tears up from the fountains of it.</USER><BOT>Mother, look at that maid with the red kerchief on her head.</BOT>
<USER>Can you go on with it, Miss Jessie.</USER><BOT>I cant say any more.</BOT>
<USER>Grandly hid, master - Ill go and fetch the wench.  [JOHN leaves the garden.</USER><BOT>And what are you about, bringing me into masters flower garden at this time of the morning?  I should like for mistress to look out of one of the windows - youd get into fine trouble, and me too, John.</BOT>
<USER>That was a rare fine maid, and no mistake.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  And a rare brazen hussy, from all that has reached my ears.</BOT>
<USER>Twas summat inside of me as drove I, then.  Twas very likely the blood of they gipsies which did leap in I, so that when I was tied up to Steve, twas as if they had got I shut in a box.  Twas the bridle on my head and the bit in the mouth of I; and to be held in where once I had gone free.  [A short pause.</USER><BOT>And I turned wild, Harry, for the very birds seemed to be calling I from the hedges to come out along of they, and the berries tossing in the wind, and the leaves blowing away quick from where theyd been stuck all summer.  All of it spoke to I, and stirred I powerful, so that one morning when the sun was up and the breeze running, I comed out into the air, Harry, and shut the door behind I.  And twas done - so twas.</BOT>
<USER>Whos getting wed up yonder, tell me quickly?</USER><BOT>Tis th old farmers daughter whats to wed come noon-tide.</BOT>
<USER>The servants be runned away same as tothers - thats all, mistress.</USER><BOT>Run away?</BOT>
<USER>So for this once, I will leave the clear high road, Joan.  And you and I will take a path that is set with thorns.  Pray God they do not wound us past healing at the end of our travel.</USER><BOT>O mistress, twill be a lightsome journey for me.</BOT>
<USER>O speak for me, mistress.  Speak for me and help.</USER><BOT>I am Clara, she is Joan.  Thomas, Emily, I pray you to forgive us both for taking you in like this.</BOT>
<USER>Why, master - the one with the cherry ribbons, to her you did say.</USER><BOT>Tis the wrong one.</BOT>
<USER>And wheres the good of that, when there baint so much as a board nor a rag, but whats been stole from I?</USER><BOT>You go and say to him as tis his wife what have come back to her place.  And put th old woman against the chimney there, and let her see you a-cutting of the bread and of the meat, and a-setting out of the food so as that they who be at the table can loose the garments of them when the eating tis finished, if they has a mind to, stead of drawing they together so not to feel tis leer.  Ah, tis time you be comed, May, tis time.</BOT>
<USER>What do you want to be taking drinks here for, when tis free as youll get them up at the school?</USER><BOT>Just a drop for to warm we through.  Here, Ill fetch it right away.</BOT>
<USER>What I do say is, lets start fair.  Neck to neck, like.</USER><BOT>As you please, my good Luke.</BOT>
<USER>Good afternoon.</USER><BOT>Now I count as you would like to know who tis thats made so bold in speaking to you, Mistress.</BOT>
<USER>What with the cows and the horses and the ganders, we shall go with our lives in our hands, as you might say.</USER><BOT>When the days got colder, we would sit under the straw rick, George and I.  And he would sing to me.  Some of his songs, I could say off by heart this day.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, you dont do them taters very nice.</USER><BOT>That dont matter, I like you, and you can tell me fine things about other parts.</BOT>
<USER>Why, master, and her might have a different ribbon to her head this day, being that tis Thursday?</USER><BOT>An eye like - like a bullace, John.  And a grand colour to the face of her like yon rose.</BOT>
<USER>Pull the hat well down about the face of you, master, so as the smooth skin of you be hid.</USER><BOT>Hows that, my friends?</BOT>
<USER>Have it your own way, Mother - and fix it as you like.</USER><BOT>These flowers were lying on the ground.</BOT>
<USER>As I walked out one May morning,</USER><BOT>So early in the Spring;</BOT>
<USER>And what if it is, Andrew.</USER><BOT>Millie, it cuts me to the heart to see your face all wet with tears.</BOT>
<USER>The wind must have lifted it from me, mistress, for I was running ever so fast.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Do you expect me to believe that, Susan - and not a breath stirring the flowers or trees, or anything?</BOT>
<USER>Upon my word, so tis.</USER><BOT>And not so bright as I should wish to see it neither.  Ive had a sad trouble with my maids of late.</BOT>
<USER>Tis the coaches I do miss down in these parts.</USER><BOT>I would not have driven one step of the way this morning, Joan.  In my fancy I have been walking up from the village and through the wood and over the meadows since many a day.  I have not forgotten one turn of the path.</BOT>
<USER>Tis naught to I which of you it be.  There bide over, so as I can get the watering finished.</USER><BOT>Now, John, you have got to speak the truth to me.</BOT>
<USER>Theyll know the both of us.  Love isnt never quite so dead but what a sound in the speech or a movement of the hand will bring some breath to it again.</USER><BOT>Youre right there, master - sommatll stir in the hearts of them when they sees we - and tis from the door as usll be chased for masking on them like this.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it.  I knowed you for a sensible lady the moment I pitched my eyes on to you.  And when master do come up, you take and talk to him nicely and meek-like and lead him on from one thing to tother: and youll find as hell go quiet as a sheep after the first set off, spite of the great spirit whats at the heart of he.</USER><BOT>John, Ill do all as you say, and more than all.  Only, you get along and send him quickly to me.  And - yes, you might give him a good hint, John - Im not averse to his attentions.</BOT>
<USER>So tis.  And if I stopped twould be the same, herd be between us always, the pretty cage bird - For look you here on I, Mother, and here -  - and here - and here - See whats been done to I whats knocked about in the world along the roads, and then think if I be such a one as might hold the love of Steve.</USER><BOT>O, do not you go for to leave your old mammy again what has mourned you as if you was dead all the years.  Do not you go for to leave I and the wicked around of I as might be the venomous beasts in the grass.  Stop with I, my pretty child - Stop along of your old mother, for the days of I be few and numbered, and the enemies be thick upon the land.</BOT>
<USER>And herll look up to th old clock, and different things whats still in their places.  The grand parts where she have been bred up will be forgot.  Twill be only home as herll think on.</USER><BOT>I havent patience to listen to such stuff.</BOT>
<USER>Certainly not.  I wonder at your asking such a question, May.  But you do say some very unsuitable things for a little child of your age.</USER><BOT>And did you get astride of the pretty horses at the Fair, Uncle?</BOT>
<USER>JULIA turns away and gives herself up to the enjoyment of the wood around her.</USER><BOT>Neither of them speak for a few minutes.</BOT>
<USER>Now dont you get so heated, master, but leave it all to me.    My good wench, it seems that there has been a little bit of misunderstanding between you and my gentleman here.</USER><BOT>So thats what you call it - misunderstanding tis a fine long word, but not much of meaning, to it, Im thinking.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a fine fat heart as her has within of she.  Dont you go and put fancies into the head of her.</USER><BOT>Ill go if so be as youll come along of me too.</BOT>
<USER>Tis to be hoped as therell be some dancing or something to liven us all up a bit down here.</USER><BOT>Why, Joan, I believe youre tired already of the country.</BOT>
<USER>Nor from your mug of drink neither, Jerry.</USER><BOT>A very pleasant sort of man.</BOT>
<USER>I mean that whats not broken dont need no mending.  Robert can go to church with someone else to-day, he can.  And no harm done.</USER><BOT>O Rose, Rose, dont take it so hard.  Twasnt Roberts fault.  Twas the girl off the road what led him on.  I know it.  Tell her to get out of the house.  Ill dress you - Ill do the work.  Only be just and sensible again; dear Rose.</BOT>
<USER>Tis the very first time as ever I caught George an idling away of his time like this.</USER><BOT>Tis over to Brook as I be going, masters, to fetch back a couple of young chicken.  Ourn be mostly old fowls, or pullets what do lay.</BOT>
<USER>Why did he think Joan was our aunt, mother?</USER><BOT>Cause he was in that state when a man dont know his right leg from his left arm.</BOT>
<USER>The day you comed here, twas a bit of ribbon as you did have around of your hair.</USER><BOT>I put it on to keep my hair neat on the journeying.</BOT>
<USER>Thats how twill be, dear John.</USER><BOT>There you be, mistress.  Fools drink for fools.  A mug of good cider would have fetched them to their senses quicker.</BOT>
<USER>Do you go off to bed, Steve, youre regular done up, and thats what tis.  I never hear-ed you take on like this afore.</USER><BOT>All right, my dear, dont you mind what Ive been saying.  Very like tis a bit unnerved as I be this night.  But tis a good thought, baint it, Annie, that come to-morrow at this time, there wont be no more need for us to part?</BOT>
<USER>Be you a-speaking of the young mistress up at Camel Farm, my lord?</USER><BOT>Yes.  With whom does she go to church to-day?</BOT>
<USER>Ducklings or chickens?</USER><BOT>Ive gotten them too.</BOT>
<USER>How sharp you are to notice anything.</USER><BOT>A very pretty looking wench, from what I can see.</BOT>
<USER>The little maidll take a brush and sweep up her daddys crumbs, now, wont her?</USER><BOT>Ill give it to any one who goes meddling in my brush cupboard now that Ive just put all in order against the prying and nozzling of the good-for-nothing baggage whats coming along with your sister.</BOT>
<USER>Help I to get off the ground then, Harry, for the limbs of me be powerful weak.</USER><BOT>The feel of your body be as burning wood, May.</BOT>
<USER>Shake hands, my maid, and very like as the memory will come back to roost same as the fowls do.</USER><BOT>Good afternoon, George.</BOT>
<USER>I wish Id never come nigh to it.  I was happier far before.</USER><BOT>Tis a grand life.  Youll see it as I do one of these days.</BOT>
<USER>And are you going to marry a beggar man instead of Andrew, who looks so brave and fine in his wedding clothes, Millie?</USER><BOT>I am going to marry him I have always loved, May - and - O Andrew, I never bore you malice, though I did say cruel and hard words to you sometimes. - But youll not remember me always - you will find gladness too, some day.</BOT>
<USER>Lord bless us, master, but what have you to do with courting?</USER><BOT>You may well ask me, John.  Why, look you here - until this very morning, you would say I was a quiet and a peaceable man, with the right place for everything and everything in its place.</BOT>
<USER>Tis all foolishness.</USER><BOT>Say can you reap with a sickle of leather</BOT>
<USER>No, that I cannot, Annet, Ive tried a score of times, I have - but there it is - I cannot.</USER><BOT>Is it that youve not forgotten Giles, then?</BOT>
<USER>But to-night twill be something cruel, for Farmer Thomas have asked them both to supper again.</USER><BOT>Luke Jenner and the other man?</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  John!  Im sick of the very name of him.  I cant think how tis that you can lower yourself by being so close with a common farm hand, William.</USER><BOT>Ah, twould be a rare hard matter to find the equal to John, Mother.  Tis of gold all through, and every bit of him, that he is made.  You dont see many like John these days, thats the truth.</BOT>
<USER>Do you get her to speak the name as was given she at baptism, Mister Hooper.</USER><BOT>This is madness.  My pretty Miss shall not be teased by such a question.  Thomas, youll have to get this stupid fellow locked up, or something.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Tother wench is but the housekeeper.</USER><BOT>Where did you get that from?</BOT>
<USER>But, Millie, hes coming for your answer now.  You musnt let him find you looking so.</USER><BOT>My face shall look as my heart feels.  And that is all sorrow, Annet.</BOT>
<USER>Give me a womans tongue for foolishness.  Ive heared a saying too in my family, which be - get a female on to your hearth and tis Bedlam straight away.</USER><BOT>Now, sister, did you ever hear the like of that?</BOT>
<USER>See the fine house youll live in.  Think on the grand parlour that youll sit in all the day with a servant to wait on you and naught but Sunday clothes on your back.</USER><BOT>Id sooner go in rags with Giles at the side of me.</BOT>
<USER>That her shant be.  Her shall just bide and sleep the drink out of her, her shall.  Do you think as I didnt find out who twas what had got at the bottle as Dad left on the dresser last night.</USER><BOT>Poor Gran, she do take a drop now and then.</BOT>
<USER>O, Ive had enough of you and - and your master.</USER><BOT>Now thats what I do like for to hear.  Because me and master have sommat else to do nor to stand giddle-gaddling in this old wood the rest of the day.  Us have got a smartish lot of worry ahead of we, havent us, master?</BOT>
<USER>Thats it.</USER><BOT>Go on, Joan, I do like the sound of it.</BOT>
<USER>Do you let me go over the field along of you, May, just to the door.</USER><BOT>No, no, Harry, get you off to the town and leave me to bide here a while in the quiet of my thoughts.  Tis of little Dorry, and of how pleased herll be to see her mammy once again, as I be thinking.  But you, Harry Moss, as hant got no home to go to, nor fireside, nor victuals, you set off towards the town.  And go you quick.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, George.  I was a young man myself once on a time.</USER><BOT>Yes, master.</BOT>
<USER>Youve got your hair different or something.</USER><BOT>The new maid.  A stupid country wench.</BOT>
<USER>For he could be led with kindness same as anything else.  But try for to drive him, as old Missis do - and very likely tis hoofed as youll get for your pains.</USER><BOT>I like a man with some spirit to him, myself.</BOT>
<USER>The sign of a stranger, so they do say.</USER><BOT>A stranger, Maggie?</BOT>
<USER>Dont say Im come too late, Miss Clara.</USER><BOT>You are.  Mister Hooper was before you.  And now, tis he and I who are like to be wed.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Tis true they are from town, but none the worse for that, William.  You have got sadly rude and cumbersome in your ways, or you wouldnt feel as you do towards a suitable young person.  Tis from getting about with John so much, I think.</USER><BOT>Now look you here, Mother, Ive got used to my own ways, and when a mans got set in his own ways, tis best to leave him there.  Im past the age for marrying, and you ought to know this better than anyone.</BOT>
<USER>Good luck to you, my man.  And if you can bring it off quiet and decent like without me coming in till at the last, why, tis a five pound note that you shall have for your trouble.</USER><BOT>You be a grand gentleman to serve, Master William, and no mistake about that.</BOT>
<USER>All I says is that I baint a-going walking with you.</USER><BOT>I never walk with two, John.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, go you straight on into the kitchen, youll find whom you be searching for in there.  Id take and shew you in myself only Im wanted down to th hayfield now.</USER><BOT>Dont put yourself to any trouble about me.  I know my way.</BOT>
<USER>I have no liking for pigs meat myself.</USER><BOT>done with you</BOT>
<USER>No, John, youre not looking straight at me.  You are looking down at the flower bed.  Let your eyes meet mine.</USER><BOT>Ive got my work to think of.  Im not one to stand cackling with a maid.</BOT>
<USER>Tis like this at the beginning. -  -</USER><BOT>Through bushes and through briars</BOT>
<USER>And a good one too, Luke, my boy, for most folk, but with me tis otherwise.  Ive got another pair of hands in the place as do for me as well, nor better than my own.</USER><BOT>Yes, Thomas, I often wonders where youd be without mine.</BOT>
<USER>Im sure I dont know, Marion - strangers, may be.</USER><BOT>O my heart goes wild this afternoon.</BOT>
<USER>Tis true her has a whitish leg, I says, but so have I, and so have you, Mother - and whos to think the worse on we for that?  Ah, I could always bring you round to look at things quiet and reasonable in those days - that I could.</USER><BOT>And a good thing if there were others of the same pattern now, Im thinking.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, and how to brew tea asll curl up anyones tongue within the mouth for a year - and fancy drinks for sheep with foot rot, and powders against the murrain and any other nonsense that you do please.</USER><BOT>Now, John, Ill not have you damage my business like this.</BOT>
<USER>Dorry, come you upstairs along with me and get your coat put on, so as your frock baint crushed.</USER><BOT>O, I wish I could go so that my nice frock was seen and no coat.</BOT>
<USER>O Ill kiss her very lightly, Mother.</USER><BOT>The flour do come from Aunt same as it does from a new loaf.</BOT>
<USER>Ive always been used to Saturday myself, but with a gentleman tis different like.</USER><BOT>Well, John, theres nothing in this day or that as far as I can see.  A bad job is a bad job, no matter what, and the day of it does make but very little difference.</BOT>
<USER>Between the sea and the salt sea strand</USER><BOT>And you shall be a true lover of mine?</BOT>
<USER>His lordship will perhaps follow us down here, mistress.</USER><BOT>No, I have forbidden it.  I must have a month of quiet, and he is to wait that time for his answer.</BOT>
<USER>That I know it would.  Why, John, my hearts commenced beating ever so fast, it has.</USER><BOT>Then you may reckon how tis with the poor master!  Why, tis my belief as twill be raving madness asll be the end of he if sommat dont come to put a finish to this unrest.</BOT>
<USER>Wed me come Michaelmas, Susan.</USER><BOT>And that Ill not.  And whats more, Im not a-going to stop here talking foolish with you any longer.  Ive work to do within.  [SUSAN goes off.</BOT>
<USER>Immodest too.  A Morris dance.  The girl should hide her face in shame.</USER><BOT>And there she is, looking at your ladyship with her gipsy eyes, bold as a brass farthing.</BOT>
<USER>Thats how tis with he, mistress.  Tis many a year as Ive served Master William - but never have I seen him in the fix where he be in to-day.</USER><BOT>Why - how is it with him then?</BOT>
<USER>Tis bound for to come from me afore you goes along to church, Steve.</USER><BOT>I warrant twill keep till us do come home again, George.</BOT>
<USER>Dont the lace look nice, Granma?</USER><BOT>You get along upstairs and do as I says, and then come straight down again.</BOT>
<USER>I was but seven when I left them all, Joan.  And that is fourteen years ago to-day.</USER><BOT>So many years may bring about some powerful big changes, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>You said as you could tell a real lady by her ways, but you couldnt very well, could he, Mother?</USER><BOT>This is the finest hearing in all the world for me, Miss - Miss Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Nay, but theres only one maid whats expected.</USER><BOT>Miss Clara, whats masters sister; and the serving wench of she.</BOT>
<USER>Off so soon!  O you have saddened me.</USER><BOT>Nay, what is it to lose a few minutes of sweet company, when life is in front of us, Miss Clara?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, she be still up above with that there serving wench whats come.</USER><BOT>My good man, you didnt expect our fair miss to have finished her toilet under an hour, did you?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, that there be - marrying.  But there baint no more victuals got into the house as I knows of.  Th old womans seen to that.</USER><BOT>And be May gone out, too, along of them to see the marrying?</BOT>
<USER>What next?</USER><BOT>Get gone at once, Jerry.</BOT>
<USER>Not unless you can account for the sort of serving wench off the roadside what Jerry has put upon us.</USER><BOT>What is there to account for in her, master?</BOT>
<USER>Tis rough work for the feet, down in these parts, mistress.</USER><BOT>If London roads were paved with diamonds Id sooner have my feet treading this rugged way that leads to home.</BOT>
<USER>There is no need for any hurry.  We have all the evening before us.</USER><BOT>Give her a blossom, master.  Tis an easy start off.</BOT>
<USER>Get along with you, Dorry.  Tis many a year afore youll be of an age for such foolishness.  And thats what I calls it, this messing about with dancing and music and I dont know what.</USER><BOT>Katie Sims be younger nor me and shes let to go, she is.</BOT>
<USER>No more than one of they old Juney bettels a-roaring and a-buzzin round a mans head.</USER><BOT>Now, John - you must tell me which of the two it is.  Is it Laura whom your master loves, or Julia?</BOT>
<USER>No, no, John.  Tisnt so bad as that.  But Im in a smartish fix, I can tell you.</USER><BOT>Hows that, master?</BOT>
<USER>O look at the flowers, Julia - Lillies, pinks and red roses.</USER><BOT>Tis a fine red rose that shall be gathered for you presently, Laura.  [JOHN comes up.</BOT>
<USER>Then youll have to take off that white thing from your face.  Tis like what mother do spread over the currant bushes to keep the birds from the fruit.</USER><BOT>Shall I give you a kiss, Aunt?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats so - Twill be more homely like for eating.</USER><BOT>i dont like eating right now</BOT>
<USER>Then Ill say sommat, Rose.  I wish twas with Isabel that I was getting wed.</USER><BOT>Now, now - Tis like two children a quarrelling over their playthings.  Suppose you was to go and get yourself dressed, Rose-Anna - And you too, Robert.  Why, the traps will be at the door afore youre ready if you dont quicken yourselves up a bit.  Kitty, you go and help your sister.</BOT>
<USER>You mustnt trouble about me, Mister Jenner.  I shall be quite comfortable presently.</USER><BOT>Please, mistress, there be a young person a-coming through the rick yard.</BOT>
<USER>O do let me wear it just a little while, just till dinner, Mother.</USER><BOT>Have done with that noise.  Off with it at once, do you hear.</BOT>
<USER>Twasnt nothing cooked, like.  Twas a bit of bread as I did ask for.</USER><BOT>Ill get it for you, Dad.  I know where the loaf bides and the knife too.  Ill cut you, O such a large piece.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, mistress should have been born a drover by rights.  Tis a grand nagging one as herd have made, and sommat what no beast would ever have got the better of.</USER><BOT>I wouldnt stand in Master Williams shoes, not if you was to put me knee deep in gold.</BOT>
<USER>- Scene 2.</USER><BOT>A few minutes later.</BOT>
<USER>Now, Joan, if I were you, I should go out into the garden, and let the gentlemen find you in the arbour.  Your ways are more easy and natural when you are in the air.</USER><BOT>O Im very nigh dead with fright when Im within doors.  Tis so hard to move about without knocking myself against sommat.  But at table tis worst of all.</BOT>
<USER>Ah - and they old maid flies do sting but once, but tis a terrible big bump as they do raise on the flesh of anyone, that tis.</USER><BOT>O John - tis a fine thing to be loved like that.</BOT>
<USER>And the horns upon the head of he did reach out very nigh as far as might do the sails of one of they old wind-mills.</USER><BOT>O Uncle, and how was it with the wool of him?</BOT>
<USER>Youre right there, master.  We have none of them up at our place.</USER><BOT>Then be pleased to accept these, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>So tis.  Tis love.</USER><BOT>Love?</BOT>
<USER>A word?  Why not say fifty?  When was a maid ever satisfied with one word Id like to know?</USER><BOT>Well - I shant say more than six, very likely, so fetch him to me now, John, and Ill wait here in the garden.  [JOHN looks at her with exasperated contempt.  Then he slowly walks away towards the house.  JULIA goes in the opposite direction to the garden gate.</BOT>
<USER>Bless my soul - wheres May?  Wheres Annet?  Send one of the little maids up to her, and tell her tis very nigh time for us to be off.</USER><BOT>Im fairly tired of sending up to her, Father.  Youd best go yourself.</BOT>
<USER>Taint with no parsons as I do hold, nor with what may come from the mouths of they, neither.</USER><BOT>And Steve, I knowed what was in his mind when parson was gone out.  Twas not much as he did say, being a man what hasnt many words to his tongue.  But he took and fetched down his big coat what do hang up yonder, and told I to put a bit of black to the sleeve of it.  Leastways, he didnt speak the words, but I seed what he was after, and I took and sewed a bit on, and hes wore it ever since till yesterday - And thats eleven year ago it be - so there.</BOT>
<USER>Your words are all right, John.  Tisnt as though sensible speech was needed.  You do know whats wanted with the maids, whilst I have never been used to them in any way whatever.  So lets say no more about it, but commence gathering the flowers.</USER><BOT>Since you say so, master.  [They begin to gather flowers.</BOT>
<USER>Best let things bide as they are, Mother.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Ill leave you no rest till you do as I wish, William.  Im got an old woman, and tis hard I should be denied in aught that Ive set my heart upon.</BOT>
<USER>I knows that full well, mistress.  But let one of them just offer hisself.  By that time my heart and his would be so closely twined together like, twould take more nor such a little thing as my station being low to part us.</USER><BOT>Listen, Joan.  Im one for the straight paths.  I like to walk in open fields and over the bare heath.  Only times come when one is driven to take to the ways which are set with bushes and with briars.</BOT>
<USER>The mistress says, please to be seated till she do come.</USER><BOT>Now, my men, we dont want the likes of you in here.  You had best get off afore Master William catches sight of you.</BOT>
<USER>O what must it feel like to be a grand lady and wear such things from dawn to bed time.</USER><BOT>I am very glad to be without them for a while.  How good the air feels on my head.</BOT>
<USER>To be sure they do.</USER><BOT>And I reckon as you could set up a home of your own any day, mister.</BOT>
<USER>But tis master as Ill be, hark you, Mother, hark you, Mill.  And tis Yes as you have got to fit your tongue out with my girl, afore tis dark.    I be agoing off to the yard, but, Mother, herll know what to say to you, her will.</USER><BOT>Dad, do you stop and shew me the inside of my packet.  Let us put Andrew aside and be happy - do!</BOT>
<USER>Tell me how it was then, George.</USER><BOT>I did used to put her on the horses back, and we would go down to the water trough in the evening time and -</BOT>
<USER>Very pleasant, Im sure.</USER><BOT>I see no objection.</BOT>
<USER>Tis with the maids as tis with the fowls when they be come out from moult.  They be bound to pick about this way and that in their new feathers.</USER><BOT>Well, tis to be hoped the young people have fixed it up for good and all this time.</BOT>
<USER>Come Thomas, come Luke, come Clara.  Us might be a barn full of broody hens the way we be set around of this here table.  Twill be midnight afore the things is cleared away and washed up.</USER><BOT>What if it be, Emily.  Tisnt very often as I gets the chance of minding how twas in times gone past.  Ah, I was a young man in those days, too, I was.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, I reckon as her be mortal angered with all the giddle-gaddle this business have set up among the folk.</USER><BOT>Ive never danced among the trees myself.</BOT>
<USER>There wont be many to the dance if it keeps on like this, will there?</USER><BOT>Get you to the fire, both of you, and warm yourselves before we sets out again.</BOT>
<USER>And that if I was to ask you once more, very likely twould be something different as you might say.</USER><BOT>Was I wrong in coming, Millie?</BOT>
<USER>That you have never seen, Andrew.</USER><BOT>And all changed in the voice of you too.</BOT>
<USER>And tie it all up with a Tom-tits feather</USER><BOT>And you shall be a true lover of mine.</BOT>
<USER>Come, Robert, if you play false to my sister at the last moment, you know with whom youll have to reckon like.  [ROBERT pays no heed to him.</USER><BOT>Can you do naught to work upon them a bit, Jerry?</BOT>
<USER>Neither shall a little gipsy wretch like you take my love from me.  We were as good as promised to each other at our christening.</USER><BOT>Dont put yourself out for the baggage, madam.  His lordship would never look on her.</BOT>
<USER>Tis the feeling of one thing and the speaking of another, with you ladies and gentlemen.  So it appears to me.</USER><BOT>No.  It is not quite like that.  But tis, perhaps, the dressing up of an ugly feeling in better garments.</BOT>
<USER>Im one as goes by other things nor looks - For like as not tis fine looks as is the undoing of most girls as has them - give me a plain face and a heart whats pure, I says, and tis not far out as youll be.</USER><BOT>Was my mammys heart pure, Granma?  [A moments silence.  JANE lights the lamp.  DORRY leans at the table, watching her.</BOT>
<USER>Id like to see you!  Flowers in the bedroom?  I never heard tell of such senseless goings on.  What next, Id like to know?</USER><BOT>Miss Clara always did fill a mug of clover blooms and set it aside of her bed when her was a little thing - so high.</BOT>
<USER>What will she bring us from out of the great boxes, do you think?</USER><BOT>Sommat what you dont need, I warrant.  Tis always so.  When folks take it into their heads to give you aught, tis very nigh always sommat which you could do better without.</BOT>
<USER>But for a certain thing, I could never have lent myself to this acting game of yours, Joan.</USER><BOT>No, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>O Master Jeremy -</USER><BOT>Come now.  Lets have a try.  I count as no one have a steadier hand nor me this side of the river, nor a finer eye for seeing as everything be in its place.  Ill settle the both of you afore I gets out the horse and trap.  Turn round.</BOT>
<USER>Im a-coming along directly.  Be careful with the candle, Dorry.</USER><BOT>Was there aught as you could do for yonder poor thing?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats right enough.</USER><BOT>Im sorry to break in upon a party like this, but I want to see Miss Clara Spring if she is here.</BOT>
<USER>I will never do so, May - only I shall know better how to be patient, and to keep the spirit of me up next time that she do strike out against me.</USER><BOT>Im not a-talking of Mill, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>Ah - now you and me will have a straight talk one with another - for tis to you I look, John, for to pull me out of this fix where the mistress has gone and put me.</USER><BOT>And that Ill do, master - with all the will in the world.</BOT>
<USER>Twas at Moat Farm I was born and bred.</USER><BOT>Close up to Daniels yonder?</BOT>
<USER>I cant learn any word that isnt no, Father.</USER><BOT>Look at me, my wench.  My foot be down.  I means what I says -</BOT>
<USER>No, no - I mean - I want to see her particular - and alone.  Ill go to meet her.  You - gentlemen - [MAGGIE goes slowly into the back kitchen.</USER><BOT>Delicate ladies should not venture out into the heat at this time of day.</BOT>
<USER>Come, Jeremy, I reckon tis not for rue nor tea of marjoram you be come here this morning?</USER><BOT>Who be they?</BOT>
<USER>Youre right there, John.  Tis Mistress Julia Ive to go at.</USER><BOT>And which of the pair would that be, Master William?</BOT>
<USER>ns the letter and reads it through.]  He will not wait longer for my answer.  And he is coming here as fast as horses can bring him.</USER><BOT>O, mistress, whatever shall we do?</BOT>
<USER>I know them.  They are gipsies from the hill near to us.</USER><BOT>They should be driven away then.  I dont like such folk roosting around.</BOT>
<USER>Theres young beans and peas and a spring cabbage too, within the basket.  I do grow a little of most everything.</USER><BOT>O shall we sit down and look at the vegetables together?</BOT>
<USER>Ive sent off Jerry.</USER><BOT>Much good thatll do.</BOT>
<USER>Thats right, then well bide a bit longer till George do call for we, only tis more nor I can stand when th old lady gets her tongue moving.</USER><BOT>Why, look, Grans fell asleep!  O, Miss Sims, now that Grans dropped off and cant say none of her foolish things any more, do stand so as Dad and Granma can see the frock which youve got for the dance.</BOT>
<USER>I be that changed from the times when I would sit a-warming of myself by this here fire.</USER><BOT>Ah, and be you changed, May?  My eyes dont see nothing of it, then.</BOT>
<USER>Tis with the nerves as he be took!</USER><BOT>Look at what hes wearing in his buttonhole, Rosie.</BOT>
<USER>As you please.</USER><BOT>CLARA.</BOT>
<USER>BUSHES AND BRIARS</USER><BOT>CHARACTERS</BOT>
<USER>Your old mother do know better nor Steve.  Ah, twerent in no shroud as I seed you, May, nor yet with the sod upon the face of you, but stepping, stepping up and down on the earth, through the water what layed on the roads, and on the dry where there be high places, and in the grass of the meadows.  Thats how twas as I did see you, May.</USER><BOT>And I would like to know how twas as Steve saw I.</BOT>
<USER>O Rose, Rose, dont take it so hard.  Twasnt Roberts fault.  Twas the girl off the road what led him on.  I know it.  Tell her to get out of the house.  Ill dress you - Ill do the work.  Only be just and sensible again; dear Rose.</USER><BOT>what will you do then</BOT>
<USER>And if it had been beggars rags upon her in the place of satin, Id have said the same.</USER><BOT>O, Mister Jenner, and did you really think like that?</BOT>
<USER>And yours wont be the only marriage Rose-Anna.  Did you never think that me and Mary might -</USER><BOT>But I did - O so many times, John.</BOT>
<USER>No, John, and that I wont.  Not till I know more about it like.</USER><BOT>Well, master, Im fairly puzzled hard to tell you.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a bit of quiet and no livening as Ox Lease do want.  Isnt that so, George, my lad?</USER><BOT>Ill say good morning to you, masters.  I count Ive been and wasted a smartish time already on the road.  We be a bit hard pressed up at the farm this day.</BOT>
<USER>Those words are like a frail bridge on which I can stand for a moment.  Georgie, do you remember the days when you used to lead me by the hand into the deep parts of the wood, lifting me over the briars and the brambles so that I should not be hurt by their thorns?</USER><BOT>Hark you here, Clara.  This once Ill speak.  I never had but one true love, and that was a little maid what would run through the woods and over all the meadows, her hand in mine.  I learnt she the note of every bird.  And when th evening was come, us would watch together till th old mother badger did get from out of her hole, and start hunting in the long grasses.</BOT>
<USER>As many girls as are needed for the dances should be in this Play.</USER><BOT>The parts of Lord Cullen and Jockie may be played by girls.</BOT>
<USER>Dont you cry, Mag.  Ill marry you when Im a big man like Daddy.</USER><BOT>Harken to them, Emily!  Shes been a good maid to the children.  Id not part with any one so hasty, if twas me.</BOT>
<USER>- Scene 1.</USER><BOT>A long table is spread with silver, china and food.  CLARA is setting mugs to each place.  MAGGIE comes in from the back kitchen with a large dish of salad.</BOT>
<USER>Is that me, John?</USER><BOT>Who else should it be, Susan?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis a different set out altogether this time.  That tis.  Tis a-marrying into your own rank, like, and no mixing up with they trolloping gipsies.</USER><BOT>Was my own mammy a trolloping gipsy, Gran?</BOT>
<USER>Im sure Im much obliged.</USER><BOT>Dont you get mixing of your meats is what I says.  Commence with ham and finish with he.  Thats what do suit the inside of a delicate female.</BOT>
<USER>We have kept her waiting a bit too long whilst we were cutting the green stuff.  And now twill be best to let matters bide over till to-morrow.</USER><BOT>Why, master tis my belief as you be all of a-tremble like.</BOT>
<USER>Ah now, whatever did!</USER><BOT>Twerent as though you might have been a young wench, flighty like, all for the town and for they as goes up and about the streets of it.  For, look you here, tis an old woman as you be now, May, and has been a twenty year or more, I dont doubt.</BOT>
<USER>O Ill go down to the field fast enough, I can tell you.  Twas only being hungered as drove me into the hornets nest, as you might say.</USER><BOT>Whats that?</BOT>
<USER>I cannot remember the name - but there was something of bushes and of briars in it.</USER><BOT>I know which that is.  Tis a pretty song.  Sing it, Georgie.</BOT>
<USER>No - Im not a-going to tell none of you.</USER><BOT>Ill tell then, for you.</BOT>
<USER>O Giles, no change of any sort could hide you from the eyes of my love.</USER><BOT>Your love, Millie.  And is that still mine?</BOT>
<USER>There she goes, through the garden with her lover.</USER><BOT>I wish that you were in his place.</BOT>
<USER>Ill put summat in your mouth asll stop you if you start screeching, mother.  Why, hark you here.  Tis enough of this old place as Ive had this night, and tis out upon the roads as I be going.  Th old woman - theres naught much changed in she - And Steve - well, Steve be wonderful hard in the soul of him.  Can I get you an old sack, says he - and never so much as seed twas I - Ah - tis more than enough to turn the stomach in anyone - that it is.  [A slight pause.</USER><BOT>I was never a meek one as could bide at the fireside for long.  The four walls of this here room have very near done for me now, so they have.  And tis the air blowing free upon the road as I craves - Ah, and the wind which hollers, so that the cries of we be less nor they of lambs new born.</BOT>
<USER>Then there isnt any change in your feelings towards me, Millie?</USER><BOT>O, theres a sort of a change, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>See how fine Mr. Davis do look - see, isnt he grand?  O, Miss Sims, see how nice the flower do look what Rosie has pinned in his coat!  See, Granma.</USER><BOT>Ive enough to do putting away all these glasses which have been messed up.  What I wants to know is when I shall get off to bed this night, seeing as tis late already and you none of you gone off yet.</BOT>
<USER>Shall I bring it in the bucket, or would the young lady like it in a jug?</USER><BOT>Theres no end to the worriting that other folks do make.</BOT>
<USER>Fine, I should think twas.  You was a fine looking wench, Mother, the day I took you to church, but tis my belief that Millie have beat you in the appearance of her same as the roan heifer did beat th old cow when the both was took along to market.  Ah, and did fetch very near the double of what I gived for the dam.</USER><BOT>Heres a drink of cold water, Millie.  I took it from the spring.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, John - the mistress has set her will to change all this.</USER><BOT>Now, youd knock me down with a feather.</BOT>
<USER>That cross, rough mode of hers sits badly on any one young, Joan.  Be more of yourself, but make little changes in your manner here and there.</USER><BOT>Tis the here and the there as I finds it so hard to manage.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, Mother, thats it.  Usll take a bit of sleep afore we sets off, wont us?  And when morning comes, usll open the door and go out.</USER><BOT>Thats it, when tis day.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, she hant any more power for to hurt I in the ugly old body of her.  I be got beyond she.  There be but one or two things as can touch I now - But one or two.  And I be struck to the heart, I be, struck to the heart.</USER><BOT>Back and fro, back and fro - On the dark of the earth and where twas light.  When twas cold and no sound but the steps of I on the road, and the foxs bark; when twas hot and the white dust smouldered in the mouth of I, and things flying did plague I with the wings of they - But twas always the same thought as I had - Some day I shall come back to Steve, I did tell me.  And then again - Some day I shall get and hold Dorry in my arms.  And now I be comed.  And Steve - and Steve - Ah, I be struck deep to the heart, tis so.  Struck deep!</BOT>
<USER>Now, Emily - take it quiet.  Why, we shall have Clara upon us before us knows where we are.</USER><BOT>Ill settle her too, if she comes before Im ready for her.</BOT>
<USER>An, do you look within this basket at the jowls what Master William have sent you.  Maybe as theyll go to your heart straighter nor what any words might.</USER><BOT>I have no liking for pigs meat myself.</BOT>
<USER>O thats a beautiful nosegay, Andrew.  Was it brought for Mill?</USER><BOT>Yes, May, but she wont have it.</BOT>
<USER>Come now, tisnt so bad as all that with we.  There baint many what has the tongue of mistress yonder.</USER><BOT>Im quite unused to such people.</BOT>
<USER>I sees enough for me.  I sees as Annie is the girl as Ive picked out of the whole world.  And I know that to-morrow she and I is to be made man and wife.  And that be pretty nigh enough for me this night, I reckon.</USER><BOT>O, Miss Sims, do you hear what Dad is saying?  O, I wonder what I should feel if twas me that was going to be married!</BOT>
<USER>Or tother one in green?</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  You appear to have used your eyes pretty well, William.</BOT>
<USER>I might have brought a couple of pounds with me if Id have thought.  Mother do keep some rare mellow jowls a-hanging in the pantry.</USER><BOT>Next time, maybe.</BOT>
<USER>And I, the mistress.  Hear that, you piece of London impudence?</USER><BOT>Master Luke be coming up the garden, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Tis not very quick as youve been, Harry Moss.  Here - give it to I fast.  Give!</USER><BOT>Tis the taste as I have thought on these many a year.  Ah, and have gotten into my mouth, too, when I did lay sleeping, that I have.  Water from yonder spout, with the taste of dead leaves sharp in it.  Drink of it, too, Harry.</BOT>
<USER>Never mind.  Run along back to mother, theres a sweet little maid.</USER><BOT>Id sooner stop with you now, you look so much kinder, like.</BOT>
<USER>O Mother, the feel of it be softer nor a doves feather.</USER><BOT>Tis better nor the new kittens fur.</BOT>
<USER>A mellower piece of pig meat I never did taste, sister.</USER><BOT>Im sorry I went and took the poultry.</BOT>
<USER>Did what?</USER><BOT>Put the thought into my head, like.</BOT>
<USER>If you think that your neckerchief is put on right tis time you should know different, Father.</USER><BOT>Whats wrong with it then, Id like to know?</BOT>
<USER>Well then, maybe as you and she will sit aside of one another in an arbour in the garden, or sommat of the sort.</USER><BOT>Yes, John.  And what next?</BOT>
<USER>I do not think she can have forgotten those days, George.</USER><BOT>Theyre best forgot.  Put them away.  There be briars and brambles and thorns and sommat of all which do hurt the flesh of man atween that time and thisn.</BOT>
<USER>Tisnt likely that anyone such as Master Andrew will ever come courting a poor girl like me, Millie.  But Id dearly love to know how twould feel.</USER><BOT>Then you shall, Annet.</BOT>
<USER>George, my boy, did you meet with any one on the way, like?</USER><BOT>Youd best ask no questions if you dont want to be served with lies, Thomas.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it.  Come girls -</USER><BOT>I pray he wont find out about me.</BOT>
<USER>Come, come, Ill have none of this - my daughter wed to a beggar off the highway!  Mother, tis time you had a word here.</USER><BOT>No, Father, Ill leave you to manage this affair.  Tis you who have spoiled Mill and brought her up so wayward and unruly, and tis to you I look for to get us out of this unpleasant position.</BOT>
<USER>Youre terribly took up with Mary Meadows, John.</USER><BOT>There isnt many like her, Kitty.  She do rear herself above tothers as - as a good wheat stalk from out the rubbish.</BOT>
<USER>Not a word, not a word.  Miss is sadly upset by your rude manners.</USER><BOT>Do you ask of the young lady but one thing, Master Hooper, and then Ill go when you will.</BOT>
<USER>O bless you for your goodness, mistress.  And I do pray as all may go as well with you as tis with me.</USER><BOT>That is not likely, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Take my word for it, George, Ox Lease will have to smarten up a bit for this young lady.  I know the circles she has been moving in, and tis to the best of everything that she has been used.</USER><BOT>Thats what mistress do say.  And thats why I be sent along down to Brook with haymaking going on and all.  Spring chicken with sparrow grass be the right feeding for such as they.  So mistress do count.</BOT>
<USER>The cottage room is full of sunlight.</USER><BOT>Someone knocks repeatedly at the door from outside.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  What lady, Susan?</USER><BOT>Her from Luthers, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Us would walk in the woods aside of one another - And I would lift she to a high branch in a tree - and pretend for to leave her there.</USER><BOT>And then?</BOT>
<USER>First love, tis best, George.</USER><BOT>Ah, upon my word, that tis.</BOT>
<USER>So I vowed I would wait till June.</USER><BOT>For the grass that has oftentimes been trampled underfoot,</BOT>
<USER>That I am sure of, madam.  I have no doubt that the delicate texture of your shoes has been sadly treated by our stones and ruts.</USER><BOT>Well, its vastly different to London streets, where I generally take exercise - at least when Im not a-riding in the coach.</BOT>
<USER>There - and now the bonnet, with the veil pulled over the face.</USER><BOT>There, Annet, there May, who is to tell which of us tis?</BOT>
<USER>Why, tis me asll do it, to be sure.</USER><BOT>Very well, Father, and we shall all be much obliged to you.</BOT>
<USER>You start and get your clothes on, master.  Tis half the battle - clothes.  What a man cannot bring out of his mouth of a Saturday will fall out easy as anything on the Sunday with his best coat to his back.</USER><BOT>No, John.  The clothes wont help me in this fix.  You must tell me how to start once I get to the farm and am by the door.</BOT>
<USER>Nay - tis to tell you that you be a rare smartish wench - and Ill go along to the church with you any day as you will name, my dear.</USER><BOT>That you wont, John.  I dont mind taking a nosegay of flowers from you now and then, and hearing you speak nice to me over the garden gate of an evening, but Im not a-going any further along the road with you.  Thats all.  [She moves towards the house.</BOT>
<USER>Because it bloomed so soon;</USER><BOT>The lily and the pink I really over think,</BOT>
<USER>Steve!  What do Steve want with another wife?  Hant he got one already which is as a rose among the sow-thistles.  What do Steve want for with a new one then?</USER><BOT>Come on, girls.  I cant stand no more of this.  Lets off, and call in to Georges as we do go by.</BOT>
<USER>There isnt a herb nor a leaf but what carries its message to them that are in pain.</USER><BOT>Give me a bloom thatll put me to sleep for always, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, twould take a lot of looking to see you as you was.</USER><BOT>Yes, I be finished with all of it now, and willing for to bide quiet at the fireside and to stay with the four walls round I and the door shut.</BOT>
<USER>I heard them call you so last night.</USER><BOT>And whatever do you want to know about Granma?</BOT>
<USER>Come, come, my lad.  I never knew you act so afore.</USER><BOT>Tis clear where he have spent his time this afternoon.</BOT>
<USER>O whatevers going on!  Rose, Rose, John - come you in here quickly, do.    O you bad, wicked girl.  I knew you couldnt be a very nice servant brought in off the road by Jeremy.</USER><BOT>Rose, Rose - come you down as quick as you can run.</BOT>
<USER>Well, but tis New Years Eve, isnt it?</USER><BOT>Ah, so tis - and a terrible nasty storm as ever I knowed!  Twas comed up very nigh to my knees, the snow, as I was a-crossing of the meadow.  And there lay some poor thing sheltering below the hedge, with a bit of sacking throwed over her.  I count tis very near buried alive as anyone would be as slept out in such a night.</BOT>
<USER>The skirt she wore was torn and ragged - that day in the forest.  She had no gold rings to her ears, nor silken scarf upon her head - But this might be her dress for holidays.</USER><BOT>That is the right music - O is it possible my quest is ended!</BOT>
<USER>When I was hid in the cupboard yonder, Andrew?</USER><BOT>So you were, May.  Well, cant you recollect how twas that she spoke to me then?</BOT>
<USER>Ive never seen your master, John, but I know quite enough about him to say Ill never wed with him.  Please to make that very clear when you get back.</USER><BOT>Tis plain as you doesnt know what you be a talking of.  And tis a wonder as how such foolishness can came from the mouth of a sensible looking maid like yourself.</BOT>
<USER>Two outside.  Female and male.</USER><BOT>Didnt I tell you so!  Theres naught that Jerry cannot do.  Youll have a drink for this, my man</BOT>
<USER>Tis a rare old she cat, and handy with the claws of her, Susans missis.</USER><BOT>Come you here, Susan, and sit along of we.</BOT>
<USER>Well, we might as well look at it afore I go to dress.</USER><BOT>Why, they are false ones.</BOT>
<USER>I prefer to remain as I be.</USER><BOT>Sister and me have our caps packed up in the tin box.</BOT>
<USER>O, Granma, she thinks ever such a lot of Miss Sims, and she says as how poor Dad, whats been served so bad, will find out soon what tis to have a real decent wife, whatll help with the work and all, and what wont lower him by her ways, nor nothing.</USER><BOT>Look you here - tis growing day.  I must be getting off and on to the road.</BOT>
<USER>And you may holler, I says to them, you may holler till you be heard over the face of all the earth, but no one wont take no account of you.  And the lies of them which have turned into ropes of hempen shall come up and strangle they.  But me and my child shall pass by all fatted up and clothed, and with the last flick, afore the eyelids of they drop, they shall behold we, and, a-clapping of the teeth of them shall they repent them of their sins.  Too late, too late!  There tis.</USER><BOT>Too late!  There tis, I be comed home too late.</BOT>
<USER>You pluck up your heart, my dearest master, and court she hard.  And in less nor a six months tis along to church as youll be a-driving she.</USER><BOT>But John, tis tother with the cherry ribbons that has taken all my fancy.</BOT>
<USER>I might.  And yet, tis a pity to cut the blooms for naught.</USER><BOT>I always takes a nosegay with me, of a Saturday night.</BOT>
<USER>Whats that?</USER><BOT>That twas in the vinegar jar as your tongue had growed, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>Tis more than I can do with, Mary.  Rose is set against Robert, and Robert is set against Rose.  Rose - well Im fairly ashamed to mention it - Rose has lost her senses and would wed the servant William - and Robert is a-courting of the maid.</USER><BOT>Ah, let each fool follow their own liking, says I.</BOT>
<USER>And did her crying cease?</USER><BOT>She would take and spring as though her was one of they little wild squirrels as do dance about in the trees.</BOT>
<USER>Tis beautiful and quiet here.  O this is ever so much better than the farm.</USER><BOT>The farm!  Whats wrong with that, I should like to know?</BOT>
<USER>Let go of my hand, I tell you.  I dont want no nonsense of that sort.</USER><BOT>Lucy, your voice do stir me in a very uncommon fashion, and theres sommat about the appearance of you -</BOT>
<USER>The door of her room is still locked, Aunt.  And what she says is that she do want to bide alone there</USER><BOT>In all my days I never did hear tell of such a thing, I dont know whats coming to the world, I dont.</BOT>
<USER>And so youre to be wed come to-morrow, Steve?  They tells me as youre to be wed.</USER><BOT>Thats right enough, Gran.</BOT>
<USER>Jowls.  O, and did you not take them?</USER><BOT>No, I sent them back to the giver, with the dry heart which was along with them in the same basket.</BOT>
<USER>You forget that Lord Lovel and I have played together as children.  It is as a brother that I look upon him.</USER><BOT>His lordship dont look upon you as a sister, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, poor Thomas!  Theres a man who goes down trod and hen scratched if you like.</USER><BOT>Tis altogether a very poor place up at Ox Lease, for young Miss.</BOT>
<USER>Old uncle did know what he was a-talking about then.</USER><BOT>Twas the gout what kept Uncle so low in his eating, twas not th inclination of him.</BOT>
<USER>Good morning, George.  A first class New Year to you.  Youre welcome, if ever a man was.</USER><BOT>You bide where you do stand, George, till your feet is dry.  My floor was fresh wiped over this morning.</BOT>
<USER>Good-morning to you, my fine gentlemen.</USER><BOT>Good-morning, master.</BOT>
<USER>Did you call, mistress?</USER><BOT>Yes, Susan.  That I did.</BOT>
<USER>I see the new servants.  John is bringing them up the walk.  The mans face is hid by his broad hat, but the girl looks neat enough in her cotton gown and sun-bonnet.</USER><BOT>There you are, mistress - man-servant and maid.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, Master Jeremy.  I was never so put out in my life, as when sister did keep on ringing and the wench was not there to help us on with our gowns.</USER><BOT>The man puts me in mind of someone whom I knew before, called Lubin.  I thought I had a fancy for him once - but twasnt really so.</BOT>
<USER>For goodness sake, Vashti, have done speaking about such things to-night.  If Steve was to hear you, why I shouldnt wonder if he was to put you out of the door and into the snow - and tis most unfitting for to talk so afore the child.</USER><BOT>Come back to I, May - you come back to I - there baint no one what thinks on the name of you, or what wants you but your old mother.  You come back to I!</BOT>
<USER>And did he lay the vegetables too?</USER><BOT>Twas all the doing of a great fool, that man of his.</BOT>
<USER>There is the very resting place for us.  We will sit down under the trees for a while.  [She seats herself.</USER><BOT>Have we much further to go, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Very likely tis a-shewing of them into their places of a Sunday and a-ringing of the bell and a-helping of the vicar along with the service, like, as has made Steve so easy.</USER><BOT>But, bless you, Mr. Davis, you sees a good bit of the gentry, too, in your way, when you goes in to houses, as it might be the Squires for to put up a shelf, or mend a window, and I dont know what.</BOT>
<USER>O thank you, George, but am I to go idle?</USER><BOT>You can take up with that there white sewing if you have a mind.  Tis more suited to your hands nor this rough job.</BOT>
<USER>To the right a fallen tree (or a bench).  JOHN comes from the left, a large bunch of flowers in his hand.</USER><BOT>Out, and a taking of the air in the wood, be they?  Well, bless my soul, but tis a rare caddling business what masters put upon I.  Tis worse nor any job he have set me to in all the years Ive been along of him, so tis.  But Im the one to bring it off slick and straight, and, bless me, if I wont take and hide myself by yon great bush till I see the wenches a-coming up.  Thatll give me time to have a quiet look at the both and pick out she what masters going a-courting of.</BOT>
<USER>And Ive never got naught but blows for my pains.</USER><BOT>O Im so sorry - No - I mean - Tis your own fault, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>Dont go away, Georgie.  Come and tell us how you like Aunt Clara now that shes growed into such a grand lady.</USER><BOT>I dont like nothing about her, Miss Jessie.</BOT>
<USER>Once let me get the fish in my net, mistress.</USER><BOT>Are you proposing to catch the two, Joan?</BOT>
<USER>Thats it.  Take her off, Nat; take her, Tansie.  And do you go along too, Chris, for I have a fancy to bide alone in the stillness of the wood for a while.</USER><BOT>Be I to leave you too, Julia?</BOT>
<USER>I must say I dont see any flowers blooming here that I should particular care about having in my apartment.</USER><BOT>And Father said as how youd like to smell the blossoms in the garden.  And Georgie told as how you did use to gather the clover blooms when you was a little girl and set them by you where you did sleep.</BOT>
<USER>But you carry a heart within you that is full of true love.</USER><BOT>What use is the love which be fastened up in a mans heart and can spend itself on naught, Id like to know.    I brought them for her.  But I count as hell have given her something better nor these.</BOT>
<USER>And the day that I am like to wed another, Giles, I said to him, the stones shall darken.  But youll never see that day.  [She begins to cry.</USER><BOT>Dont you give way, Millie, for, look you, tis very likely that Giles has forgotten you for all his fine words, and Andrew, - well, Andrew hes as grand a suitor as ever maid had.  And tis Andrew you have got to wed, you know.</BOT>
<USER>But Ive got no feelings that I can tell her of, Mother.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Then youll please to find some, William.</BOT>
<USER>I have no liking for pigs meat myself.</USER><BOT>why not a higher value</BOT>
<USER>I have.  And O, Julia, he is a beautiful gentleman.  I never saw one that was his like.</USER><BOT>The rare red rose with its thorn, Laura.</BOT>
<USER>Listen, Millie - tis a month since I last spoke with you.  Do you recollect?  Twas the evening of the great Fair.</USER><BOT>MILLIE And what if it was?</BOT>
<USER>O, I wanted to be let to go to the dancing now Id got it on, I did.</USER><BOT>Dancing, there you are!  Dancing and finery, tis all as you do think on, and tis plain to see whats got working in the inside of you, Dorry.  Tis the drop of bad blood as you has got from she what bore you.  But I might as well speak to that door for all you cares.  Only, hark you here, youll be sorry one of these days as you hant minded me better.  And then twill be too late.</BOT>
<USER>Id be content with a suitable behaviour, Father.  Im not hard to please.</USER><BOT>Ah, you take and let her go quiet, same as I lets th old mare when her first comes up from grass.</BOT>
<USER>And Aunt has been here two days and more, and she hasnt brought us nothing.</USER><BOT>Your fine aunt have been too much took up with her fancy gentlemen to think of what would be suitable behaviour towards you children.</BOT>
<USER>Millie, what are you stopping for?  Come you up here and get your gown on, do.</USER><BOT>All alone, Andrew?  Has Millie gone to put her fine gown on?</BOT>
<USER>Why, George - I guess as its took you as it took me, us didnt think how twould appear when Miss Clara was growed up.</USER><BOT>No, us did not, master.</BOT>
<USER>Indeed I do.</USER><BOT>Thats where I do live.</BOT>
<USER>The Master said that I might come along to-night, Millie - Otherwise - [ANNET is still silent.</USER><BOT>Otherwise I shouldnt have dared do so.</BOT>
<USER>Aught that can turn our faithless lovers back again to we?</USER><BOT>That I have.  See these small packages - you that love Robert, take you this - and you who courted Rose-Anna, stretch out your hand.</BOT>
<USER>The very same, mistress.  And as grand a gentleman as anyone might wish for to see.</USER><BOT>Yes - I seem to have heard something told about him, but I dont rightly remember what twas.</BOT>
<USER>Maggie, you idle, bad girl, whatever are you doing here when master expects you down in the meadow to help with the raking?</USER><BOT>I be just a-going off yonder, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>And the ceiling above, Nat.  And locked door.  And other folk lying breathing in the house, hard by.  All dark and close.</USER><BOT>And where us may lie, the air do run swift over we.  We has the smell of the earth and the leaves on us as we do sleep.  There baint no darkness for we, for the stars do blink all night through up yonder.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Then tis time you did begin.</USER><BOT>And whats more, Ill not do it, neither.</BOT>
<USER>No, Father, Giles has never sent a letter since the day he left home.  But very often there is no need for letters to keep remembrance green.  Tis a plant what thrives best on a soil that is bare.</USER><BOT>what is your best day</BOT>
<USER>Well, Ive done my best to get us out of the fix.</USER><BOT>And what would that be, pray?</BOT>
<USER>Ive brought you a nosegay of flowers, Mill.  They be rare blossoms with grand names what I cant recollect to all of them.</USER><BOT>I have no liking for flowers this day, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>A good wife to do and manage for you.</USER><BOT>I never was done for nor managed by a female yet, and blowed if I will be now.</BOT>
<USER>A handful of gold, my boy, if you lead me rightly.</USER><BOT>You might curtsey to the gentleman, Susan.</BOT>
<USER>- Scene 1.</USER><BOT>GILES comes forward with his two servants, GEORGE and JOHN, who are carrying heavy packets.</BOT>
<USER>Its a good thought, baint it, Annie, that to-morrow this time there wont be no need for us to part?  And in the days when I was a young woman and all the bloom of I upon me, twouldnt have been once as hed have looked on such as her.</USER><BOT>And tis full of bloom and rare fine and handsome as you appear now, May, leastways to my old eyes.  And when you goes up to Steve and shows yourself, I take it the doorll be shut in the face of the mealy one what theyve all been so took up with this long while.  I count that twill and no mistake.  So tis.</BOT>
<USER>To do up in the front - sensible like.</USER><BOT>Being as grey as th old badger dont keep a female back from vanity.</BOT>
<USER>And leave them in their hate for one another?  No - twould be too cruel.  Usll run to the young mistress what knows all about them herbs.  I count as there be seeds or sommat which could set the hearts of them two back in the right places again.  Come -</USER><BOT>Have it your own way then.  But twill have to be done very quickly if tis done at all.</BOT>
<USER>Here, sit down, Annet, with the back of you to the light.</USER><BOT>Can I get into the cupboard and listen to it, Cousin Mill?</BOT>
<USER>That neckerchief is not quite the thing, Luke.</USER><BOT>Tis my Sunday best.</BOT>
<USER>O theres nothing amiss, thank you.</USER><BOT>Amiss, who said as there was?  When folks what can afford to lodge at the inn do come down and fasten theirselves on the top of poor people, they must take things as they do find them and not start grumbling at the first set off.</BOT>
<USER>O do let us sit up till midnight, Dad.</USER><BOT>I shall eat a smartish lot more if we does.</BOT>
<USER>Look you here, young woman.  Suppose you was to take and do something useful with that idle pair of hands as youve got.</USER><BOT>Yes, mistress, I should like to help you in something.</BOT>
<USER>Thats right - drink your fill, Mother.</USER><BOT>Tis pleasant for I to see you mistressing it here again, May.</BOT>
<USER>You are partial to the colour?</USER><BOT>Ah, tis well enough.</BOT>
<USER>O, I hear you, Clara.  Thomas, this is very fine.  Clara cant feed cause shes not used to country fare!  What next, Id like to know!</USER><BOT>Why does Aunt sometimes put her knife in her mouth, Mother?</BOT>
<USER>Now, John, youve got to get me out of the fix where Im set.</USER><BOT>O my dear master, dont you take on so.  Tis a little bit of misunderstanding to be sure, but one as can be put right very soon.</BOT>
<USER>Tis very likely someone with a horse whats lost a shoe, Steve.</USER><BOT>I guess as tis a coffin wanted sudden, George Davis.</BOT>
<USER>I wonder what that could have been?</USER><BOT>Twas them being such very nice and kind gentlemen.  And, O mistress, youll not understand it, because youve told me many times as the heart within you have never been touched by love.</BOT>
<USER>So tis.  And the tea what she gived me was but ditch water.  I seed her spoon it in the pot, and twas not above a half spoon as her did put in for I, th old badger.  My eye was on she, though, and herll have it cast up at she when the last day shall come and the trumpet sound and all flesh stand quailing, and me and mine looking on at her as is brought to judgment.  How will it be then, you old sinner, says I.</USER><BOT>Take and drink this little drop more, mother.</BOT>
<USER>The trees have not eyes, nor have the grass, and flowers.  Theres no one to see me but you, and you can turn your head tother way.  Come Tansie, come</USER><BOT>[She turns towards the three gipsies.</BOT>
<USER>Nicely, Steve, nicely.  Good evening, Mrs. Browning.  Miss Sims, good evening - Yes, Steve, Ill off with my coat, for tis pretty well sprinkled with snow, like.</USER><BOT>A happy New Year to you, Mr. Davis.</BOT>
<USER>O, Mister Jenner, why?</USER><BOT>Because, very like twould shew to you as tis yourself Im after and not the fortune what youve got.</BOT>
<USER>Come to that, I didnt expect the house to look as it do.</USER><BOT>Very ancient in appearance, Im sure.</BOT>
<USER>Im certain of it, mistress.</USER><BOT>And the man I - I love will never let his heart go out to mine with the heaviness of all these riches lying between us.</BOT>
<USER>All shall be ready in a moment, Miss Kitty.</USER><BOT>Very comfortable, Im sure.  But I count as that there old-fashioned grate do take a rare bit of elbow grease.</BOT>
<USER>I havent patience with th old gipsy!  Yes - Steve.  And tis a twelvemonth or more as youd knowed of it.</USER><BOT>what is your name</BOT>
<USER>And be these garments which you be clothed in for marriage or for burial?</USER><BOT>Come, Granny, have another cup of tea.  Annie, dont you take no account of she.  Tis worry and that as have caused the mind of she to wander a bit, but she dont mean nothing by it.</BOT>
<USER>I reckon as youll be glad enough to eat up every one of them words the day you claps eyes on Master William, for a more splendid gentleman nor he never fetched his breath.</USER><BOT>Ill never wed a farmer, John.</BOT>
<USER>Well, theres nothing more to be said about that now, Andrew.  That nights over and done with.</USER><BOT>Ive carried the thought of it in my heart all this time, Millie.</BOT>
<USER>Us poor old wretches dont carry no hearts to th insides of we.  The pains of us do come from the having of no victuals and from the winters cold when snow do lie on the ground and the wind do moan over the fields, and when the fox do bark.</USER><BOT>What is the pang of hunger and the cold bite of winter set against the cruel torment of a disappointed love?</BOT>
<USER>Sing Ivy Leaf, Sweet William and Thyme</USER><BOT>And sow it all over with one peppercorn</BOT>
<USER>Theres a plaguey, fanciful kind of feel about the day, what a mans hardly used to, so it seems to me.</USER><BOT>O, I reckon we may get used to it in time afore we die.</BOT>
<USER>No smile upon your lips, Millie.</USER><BOT>Have I anything to smile about, Andrew?</BOT>
<USER>Usll go upstairs and dress, sister.</USER><BOT>Tis time we did so.  All them new-fashioned things be awkward in the fastenings.</BOT>
<USER>Youll harden to it all by winter time right enough.</USER><BOT>O Ill never harden to it.  Tis not that way I am made.  Some girls can set themselves down with four walls round them, and do their task nor ask for anything beyond, but tis not so with me.</BOT>
<USER>Robert, cant you take and explain a bit what tis.</USER><BOT>A little bit of play twixt me and the wench there, and thats about all, I reckon.</BOT>
<USER>Do not you Master me, Isabel.  Im only a common servant in the house where once I was lover and almost brother.</USER><BOT>O do not take it so hard, Lubin - Us can do naught at this pass but trust what the young woman did tell me.</BOT>
<USER>And how long may you have bid there, I should like to know?</USER><BOT>Come, come, my little maid, tis early days for you to be getting a lesson in courtship.</BOT>
<USER>I count tis very nigh as bad as the treadmills, serving a young miss such as yourn be.</USER><BOT>What makes you say that, Maggie?</BOT>
<USER>Why, I couldnt be sitting there all the while, now could I, Aunt?</USER><BOT>Thisll be the last time as I tie your ribbon, mind.</BOT>
<USER>Much the same as the other one wanted.</USER><BOT>Must I see him?</BOT>
<USER>I am afraid not.  These coral beads are for Miss Jessie, with her aunts dear love.  And this book of pictures is for Master Robin.</USER><BOT>ting them on.]  How do they look on me?</BOT>
<USER>My gardener stood by</USER><BOT>And told me to take great care,</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  That you shall, William - and quickly too.  Theres no time like the present, and your Sunday clothes are upon you still.</USER><BOT>I was just going up to change, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>They feel as good as strangers to me, any way.</USER><BOT>Ah, how well I understand that, Miss.  Tisnt very often as we lay a length of fine silken by the side of unbleached woollen at my counters.</BOT>
<USER>Joan doesnt know how to do them very nicely, does she George!</USER><BOT>Tis the first time youve been set down to such work, may be, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>And I up and says to they, Ah, and you would hustle a poor old woman whats never harmed so much as a hair out of the ugly heads of you.  You would hunt and drive of her till she be very nigh done to death.  But there shall come a day when you shall be laid down and a-taking of your bit of rest, and the thing what you knows of shall get up upon you and smite you till you do go screeching from the house, and fleeing to the uttermost part of the land - whilst me and mine -</USER><BOT>Beg pardon, old Missis, but I couldnt make no one hear me.</BOT>
<USER>O, tis best saved against to-morrow.  The freshness will be most gone from it, if I was to wear it now.</USER><BOT>No, no, Mr. Davis, tis for now!  To wear at the dance.  Put it on him, Rosie, put it on him.</BOT>
<USER>Yes.</USER><BOT>Why, I count as I have went a score of times, master.</BOT>
<USER>Cut and clipped and trimmed and dry as that box tree yonder.  And you be getting sommat of the same fashion about you, John.</USER><BOT>Then make me differenter, Susan, you know the way.</BOT>
<USER>If we have made a small error, madam, allow me to beg your pardon.</USER><BOT>Dont mention it, sir.  Everyone is mistaken sometimes.</BOT>
<USER>How do you know I am going to Ox Lease, sir?</USER><BOT>You see, madam, I happen to know that a stylish young miss from town is expected there to-day.</BOT>
<USER>And if ever you should pass this way come spring-time, Harry, when the bloom is white on the trees, and the lambs in the meadows, come you up to the house yonder, and may be as Ill be able to give you summat to keep in remembrance of me.  For to-day, tis empty-handed as I be.</USER><BOT>I dont want nothing from you, May, I dont.</BOT>
<USER>Id dearly like to be a countess, Marion.</USER><BOT>His lordship might think I was the maid.  Im spry upon my feet you know.</BOT>
<USER>Come along then - all of you.</USER><BOT>We shall hope for your company, too.</BOT>
<USER>I am brave, Millie, now that you speak to me so kind and gentle, and Ill ask you to name the day.</USER><BOT>O twill be a very long distance from now, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>Well, well - she wont do us no harm where she do bide.  Leave her in the warm till tis daylight, then let her go her way.</USER><BOT>She and Gran be about right company one for tother, Im thinking.</BOT>
<USER>See there, that man of Master Gardners be a-coming along towards us fast.  Look yonder -</USER><BOT>O whatever shall I do?  Tis John, and surely he will tell of me when he gets back.</BOT>
<USER>See here, my little maid, whatll you give Mister Hooper for bringing this pretty lady safe up to the farm?</USER><BOT>I know who tis youve brought.  Tis my Aunt Clara.</BOT>
<USER>That it have, mistress.  Love have struck at it heavily.</USER><BOT>Through which of the gentlemen did it strike, Joan?</BOT>
<USER>Its Lucy, behaving dreadful - O you must send her straight away from the house, Rose.</USER><BOT>What has she done, then?</BOT>
<USER>I dont doubt but that I shall be able to do that too, mistress.</USER><BOT>Very well.  Take the gown and come with me up to my room.</BOT>
<USER>Ive enough to do putting away all these glasses which have been messed up.  What I wants to know is when I shall get off to bed this night, seeing as tis late already and you none of you gone off yet.</USER><BOT>what is your last chance</BOT>
<USER>Some cattle want a lot of driving.</USER><BOT>If I go, could not you try and come along with me, master?</BOT>
<USER>Twas grand as a tree in full leaf and the wind a-moving all the green of it as was your mammy, my dear.</USER><BOT>And did she have fine things to her, nice gowns and things, like Miss Sims, Granny?</BOT>
<USER>She is followed by MARION - also reading.</USER><BOT>Well, tis like to be a fine set out, this May Day.</BOT>
<USER>There, do you see this little scar?  I was helping George to feed the ducks and geese when the fierce gander ran after me and knocked me down and took a piece right out of my arm.</USER><BOT>I have often seen that there mark, mistress.  And do you think as that old gander will be living along of the poultry still?</BOT>
<USER>Come you here, George, and look at my fine book what Aunt have brought me.</USER><BOT>That be a brave, fine book of pictures, Master Robin.</BOT>
<USER>You might as well have brought the jug, my girl.</USER><BOT>No, Father, twill spoil your next meal as it is.</BOT>
<USER>Be quiet, Thomas.  This is my business, and youll please to keep your words till theyre wanted.</USER><BOT>O mistress, I didnt mean no harm, I didnt.</BOT>
<USER>Then go you out upon your way, Harry Moss, for the dark be gathering on us fast, and there be many a mile afore you to the town, where the lamps do shine and tis bright and warm in the places where they sells the drink.</USER><BOT>Once I sets off running by myself, Ill get there fast enough, May.  But I be going to stop along of you a bit more, for I dont care much about letting you bide lonesome on the road, like.</BOT>
<USER>Why are you heavy and sad this fine day, Nat?</USER><BOT>Tis love whats the matter with he, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>See there, Joan.  Youve been and cut that big tater right in half.  Mother will be cross.</USER><BOT>O dear, I am thoughtless.  One cannot work and talk at the same time.</BOT>
<USER>I dont know.</USER><BOT>Poor Georgie.  He never has nothing gived him.</BOT>
<USER>I reckon as he did come out to show her as he knowed all what she did keep in her mind.</USER><BOT>Very likely the briars were so thick between them, Jess, that he never got to the other side for her to tell him.</BOT>
<USER>You used to sing sommat - the grass that was trampled under foot, give it time, it will rise up again.</USER><BOT>Ah, it has risen, dear John - and I count it have covered the wound of those past days - my heart do tell me so, this minute.</BOT>
<USER>And I could well mistake her for myself too, so listen, Annet.  Tis you that shall talk with Master Andrew when he comes to-night.  And tis you that shall give him my answer.  Ill not burn my lips by speaking the word he asks of me.</USER><BOT>O Mill - I cannot - no I cannot.</BOT>
<USER>And the man?</USER><BOT>Much the same as any other male.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, run along and get them, Dorry; very likely twill give her thoughts a turn, looking at the things, seeing as she be in one of her nasty moods to-day when you cant get a word what isnt foolishness out of her.  [DORRY runs upstairs.</USER><BOT>Was her telling of a marriage?</BOT>
<USER>ROBERTS cousins are standing by the fire-place of the same room.</USER><BOT>Tis powerful unhomely here, Jane.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis so, tis so.  And tis rare glad as themll be to see I once again.  Steve, hes a hard man, but a good one - And Ill tell you this, Harry Moss, hell never take up with no woman whats not me - and that he wont - I never knowed him much as look on one, times past; and twill be the same as ever now, I reckon.  And little Dorry, twill be fine for her to get her mammy back, I warrant - so twill.</USER><BOT>Th old woman - well - I shant take it amiss if her should be dead, like.  Her was always a smartish old vixen to I, that her was, and her did rub it in powerful hard as Steve was above I in his station and that.  God rest the bones of she, for I count herll have been lying in the churchyard a good few years by now.  But I baint one to bear malice, and if so be as hers above ground, tis a rare poor old wretch with no poison to the tongue of she, as herll be this day - so tis.</BOT>
<USER>How should I act so not to be found out, mistress?</USER><BOT>You must speak little, and low.  Do not show haste in your goings and comings.  Put great care into your way of eating and drinking.</BOT>
<USER>Nay, she be but just come from upstairs, Mother.  Let her bide quiet a while with young Andrew here; whilst do you come along with me and get me out my Sunday coat.  Tis time I was dressed for church too, Im thinking.</USER><BOT>I dont know whats come to the house this morning, and thats the truth.  Andrew, Ill not have you keep Millie beyond a five minutes.  Tis enough of one another as youll get later on, like.  Father, go you off upstairs for your coat.  Tis hard work for me, getting you all to act respectable, that tis.</BOT>
<USER>Whats that?</USER><BOT>Tis work.</BOT>
<USER>And Im Robin.</USER><BOT>Now, I wager, if you are both good little children, this pretty lady will give you each a kiss.</BOT>
<USER>What has upset you against the wedding, Jerry?</USER><BOT>One pair of hands baint enough for such goings on.</BOT>
<USER>So now, each maid of us in the village and all around be to dance upon the green come May Day so that my lord may see who twas that pleased his fancy.</USER><BOT>And when he do pitch upon the one, tis her as he will wed.</BOT>
<USER>Anything to oblige a lady, miss.</USER><BOT>Thats right.  Usll wait while you do lay aside your bonnet.</BOT>
<USER>To comfort you for the pains of the country, Joan.</USER><BOT>O mistress, let us stop a moment longer in this quiet place so that I may slip them on and see how they become me.</BOT>
<USER>All right, Steve, and do you cast an eye around to see as I hant left nothing out as might get took away, for tis poor work leaving the kitchen to roadsters and gipsies and the like.</USER><BOT>To-morrow night, Annie!</BOT>
<USER>Here I be, Mrs. Reed.</USER><BOT>Be you the one whats going to wed our Steve come New Year.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Steve?</USER><BOT>Well, Rosie.</BOT>
<USER>Then let us be off, master, for the time be running short.</USER><BOT>Ah, that tis.  I count it be close on noon-day now by the look of the sun.</BOT>
<USER>Why, if tisnt George from Ox Lease.</USER><BOT>No, sit you down again, my lad, and well rest awhile by the side of you.</BOT>
<USER>Im sure I dont care.  I reckon that one things about as good as another to be married with.</USER><BOT>Ah - I daresay tis so.</BOT>
<USER>And who are these persons, Giles?</USER><BOT>Here they be, my lord, and I warrant as youll feel more homely like in they, nor what youve got upon you now.  [GILES takes the things from him.</BOT>
<USER>Dont flatter yourself as Thomas needs you, my man.</USER><BOT>We has always been good friends, farmer and me.  Tis not for what I gets from he nor for what he do get out of I as we do hold together.  But tis this - as he and I do understand one another.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, Mill.  Twouldnt do for to mess them up afore the day.  Twas a fair price as I gived for they, and that I can tell you, my girl.</USER><BOT>Come off, come off, Cousin Millie; tis not damp outside, and O Im afeared to cross the rickyard by myself.</BOT>
<USER>Set another place, Lucy.</USER><BOT>Not for me, Rose.  I did not come here to eat or drink, but to bring you these few blossoms and my love.</BOT>
<USER>I never takes no count of a females vapours.  Youll come along of me.  Youll curl the mistresss hair and lace her gown and keep her tongue quiet - and you  my man, will set the tables and wait upon the quality what we expect from Bristol town this dinner-time.</USER><BOT>I never waited on man nor woman in my life, and Ill not start now.</BOT>
<USER>George!  Youll all find out your mistake one day, Thomas.</USER><BOT>My sweet Miss is not shewing any appetite.</BOT>
<USER>O that I will, my good, dear John.</USER><BOT>cool. that worked great</BOT>
<USER>LORD LOVEL.</USER><BOT>GEORGE, aged 28.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats right enough.  And there be jobs as I wish Master William would get and do for hisself instead of putting them on I.</USER><BOT>Well, and how far may you be going this afternoon?</BOT>
<USER>Here tis, Granma, shall I light the candle?</USER><BOT>So long as youll hold the matches careful.</BOT>
<USER>And that it wont, mistress.</USER><BOT>O you are fair spent from journeying.  Can I do anything for you, master?</BOT>
<USER>They might get saying - they might say as - as Id got a-courting, or sommat foolish.</USER><BOT>Well - and would that be untrue?</BOT>
<USER>Im out to find them asll manage for them.    Be you in search of work, young man?</USER><BOT>I - I count as Ive nothing particular in view.</BOT>
<USER>Master, if twas an acre of stone as youd asked me to plough, Id sooner do it nor a job like this.</USER><BOT>John, youve been a good friend to me all the years that you have lived on the farm, youll not go and fail me now.</BOT>
<USER>Oh, I count as that must be a rare sort of a place, master.</USER><BOT>Seeing as us havent stopped scarce an hour since us landed off the sea.</BOT>
<USER>See those leaves and flowers drying in the sun?  Theres medicine for every sort of sickness there, sir.</USER><BOT>Theres not a root nor yet a herb on the face of the earth that could cure the sickness I have within me.</BOT>
<USER>I remembers Miss Clara right enough.</USER><BOT>Dont you flatter yourself, George, as such a coxsy piece of town goods will trouble herself to remember you.</BOT>
<USER>You never went a-courting with a servant wench, now did you, my hearts dearest?</USER><BOT>Never in all my days, Rose.  Twas but the fanciful thoughts of a boy towards she, that I had.</BOT>
<USER>Id leave the windows bare if it was me, Emily.  The creeping rose do form the suitablest shade for they, to my thinking.</USER><BOT>That shews how much you know about it, Thomas.  No, take your hands from off my table.  Do you think as I wants dirty thumbs shewing all over the clean net what Ive washed and dried and ironed, and been a-messing about with since twas light?</BOT>
<USER>Then you didnt ought to have done so.  Lets get off now, before they come up.</USER><BOT>No, no.  Let us talk to them all.    Tansie and Chris, come you here and sit down alongside of us.  [CHRIS, NAT, and TANSIE come up.</BOT>
<USER>There, run along quick and find your sister.  Suppers late already, and that it is.</USER><BOT>Ill go with her.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tother was plainer in her dressing, and did keep the head of her bent smartish low on her book, so that a man couldnt get a fair look upon she.</USER><BOT>That would be the housekeeper or summat.  Tis Julia, who has the old mans money, Im to court.</BOT>
<USER>I gets enough of that from mistress - I mean - well - I mean -   - O mistress is a wonderful fine woman and no mistake.</USER><BOT>You wont say as much when she comes round the corner and catches you a wasting of your time like this, John.</BOT>
<USER>Depend upon it tis two wicked thieves we have got among us, flying from justice.</USER><BOT>No, no - did not you hear them say, their master is Giles.</BOT>
<USER>Id - Id like to show you how tis in my garden, one of these days.</USER><BOT>Id be very pleased to walk along with you there.</BOT>
<USER>Well - tis to be hoped as twill be all right this time.</USER><BOT>This time, Granma!  Why, wasnt it all right when Dad was married afore, then?</BOT>
<USER>My Dads ever so pleased, I hant seen him so pleased as I can remember.  I hant.</USER><BOT>Then maybe the second choosing be the best.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis in the grave as poor Master William will be landed soon if you dont have a care.</USER><BOT>O is he so delicate as that, John?</BOT>
<USER>Just to take off the brown of my freckles.  Now if any one was to come upon me sitting here they wouldnt know as I was other than a real, high lady.  All covered with this nice cloak as I be, the French bonnet on my head, and powder to my face, whos to tell the difference?  But O - these must be hid first.</USER><BOT>How should I act now if some grand gentleman was to come up and commence talking to me?  Perhaps he might even take me for a lady of title in these fine clothes, and twould be a pity to have to undeceive him.</BOT>
<USER>Take and peel and wash them and get them ready against when I wants to cook them.</USER><BOT>Yes - Ill - Ill try -</BOT>
<USER>Ive heard tell as a farmer do spin gold all the day same as one of they great spiders as go putting out silk from their mouths.</USER><BOT>And what is gold to me, Chris, who have no one but myself to spend it on</BOT>
<USER>And who may you be, I should like to know?  You appear to be making very free with my parlour.</USER><BOT>We be the servants what wait upon Master Giles, old Missis.</BOT>
<USER>Annet - will you come there with me too?</USER><BOT>O Andrew - what are you saying?</BOT>
<USER>Our young missy had a wish for solitude.  She sent her maid on by another road.</USER><BOT>The good-for-nothing hussy.  I warrant as she have found something of mischief for her idle hands to do.</BOT>
<USER>Say how the face of I do seem to you now, Harry, and then Ill tell you how twas in the days gone by?</USER><BOT>Tis all too dark like for to see clear, May.  The night be coming upon we wonderful fast.</BOT>
<USER>In time for what, my good man?</USER><BOT>In time for to see the marrying, my lord.</BOT>
<USER>I know of flowers that can heal even the pains of love.</USER><BOT>O tell me of them quickly, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Theyre coming up the path.  Tis our fine auntie and two grand gentlemen either side of she.</USER><BOT>O I want to look on her too.</BOT>
<USER>O say ye, Uncle, for look how fine and grand he is in his coat - and the bags are stuffed full to the brim and tis with gold and silver.</USER><BOT>Well - tis a respectabler end than I thought as youd come to, Giles.  And different nor what you deserved.</BOT>
<USER>Sit down, Granny, by the fire, do.</USER><BOT>Tis in the house and out of it as I have went.  And down to the pool where the ice do lie, and up on the fields where tis fog, And there be summat in I what drives I onward, as might the wind.  And no where may the bones of me rest this day.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a new, smart bonnet, my wench.</USER><BOT>For me, Father?</BOT>
<USER>Come on, Dorry - you take hold of me.  You and me, well keep nigh one to tother this day, wont us?</USER><BOT>Come on, Mr. Davis.</BOT>
<USER>Get you out of that there place this instant, do you hear?   To see the way the young person acts one might think as she fancied herself as something uncommon rare and high.  But youll not take any fool in, not you, for all that you like to play the fine lady.  Us can see through your game very clear, cant us, Mr. Hooper?</USER><BOT>O certainly, to be sure, Missis Spring.  No one who has the privilege of being acquainted with a real lady of quality could be mistook by any of the games played by this young person.</BOT>
<USER>I be not, sir.  Tis mother to May as I be.  May, whats comed back, and whatll set tother old vixen in her place soon as they get home.</USER><BOT>Then May, she be gone out, too, have her?</BOT>
<USER>Courting?</USER><BOT>Yes.  That tis.  Tis our Master William whats dressed up in his Sunday clothes and gone a-courting with a basket of green stuff on his arm big enough to fill the market, very nigh.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and that us dont.  Us be a wedding party here, and tis for you to get moving on, old man.</USER><BOT>He is poor and old.  And he has wandered far, in the heat of the morning.  Look at his sad clothing.</BOT>
<USER>Shall I, Mr. Davis?</USER><BOT>You be so quiet like to-night, Annie.  There isnt nothing wrong, is there, my dear?</BOT>
<USER>And troubled in my mind,</USER><BOT>Sometimes I think Ill go to my love</BOT>
<USER>A gipsy wench, mistress, who minds the goats and pigs for one of they great farms.</USER><BOT>Have a care for that tongue of yours, madam waiting maid.  For I know how to lay sommat upon it what you wont fancy.</BOT>
<USER>Look you, May, you get and run up, and knock at the door and tell her that twill soon be time for us to set off to church and that she have got to make haste in her dressing.</USER><BOT>Ill run, Aunt, only tis very likely as shell not listen to anything that I say.  [MAY goes out.</BOT>
<USER>Or for when you be took with th air in your head so bad, Jane.</USER><BOT>Yes, I reckon that Mary has a charm for every ill beneath the sun.  Lets go off to the parlour along of her.  Youre not coming with us, John, are you?</BOT>
<USER>Come on, come on, all of you.  Tis time we was at the church.</USER><BOT>Hark to him!  Hes in a rare hurry for to get out of the house to-day.</BOT>
<USER>You must do more than that for me, John.  Youve got to learn me how the courting is done before I set off.</USER><BOT>Why, master, courting baint a thing what wants much learning, thats the truth.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, my little maid.  Run along - and look you, May, just you tell Cousin Millie as we wants her in here straight away.  And who knows bye and bye whether there wont be sommat in yon great parcel for a good little wench.</USER><BOT>O Uncle - Id like to see it now.</BOT>
<USER>Get you to Steve and let him see you with the candle lit.  Her baint no match for he, the young weasel!  Tis you as has the blood of me and my people what was grand folk in times gone by, tis you, May, as is the mate for he, above all them white-jowled things what has honey at the mouth of they, but the heart running over with poison - Ah, and what throws you the bone and keeps the meat for their own bellies.  What sets the skin afore you and laps the cream theirselves.  Vipers, all of them, and she-cats.  There tis.</USER><BOT>Sit you down, Mother, and keep the tongue of you quiet.  We dont want for to waken they.</BOT>
<USER>Why, youre worse nor Dad, I do declare!  But you just look at Rosie, now, Mr. Davis, and ask her what shes got wrapped up in that there paper in her hand.</USER><BOT>O, Dorry, you little tease, you!</BOT>
<USER>The room is divided by a curtain which screens the fireside end from the draught of the principal door.</USER><BOT>Chairs are grouped round the hearth, and there is a table at which JANE BROWNING is ironing a dress by the light of one candle.  DORRY leans against the table, watching her.</BOT>
<USER>Tis to be hoped as she will be.  Such a set out in the house I have never seen afore in all my days.  Young women as is hale and hearty having their victuals took up to their rooms and a-lying in bed till tis noon or later.</USER><BOT>Tis only one of them as lies in bed.</BOT>
<USER>A twelve year gone by, what then, Granny?</USER><BOT>Tis moren eleven years since her wented out of the door, my child - your poor mammy.  Out of the door, out of the door!  And likely as not twill be feet first as her shall be brought in again.</BOT>
<USER>And is it to tell me such foolishness that youve brought me all the way out of the kitchen?</USER><BOT>And to give you this flower, dear Susan.</BOT>
<USER>Susans a terrible hard wench to court, Master William.</USER><BOT>Twill make the better lesson, John.</BOT>
<USER>Why, tis Lord Cullen putting it about as how he be back from the war and thinking of getting himself wed, like.</USER><BOT>I understands that much, I do.</BOT>
<USER>Never you mind.  Get and take your elbow off my ironing sheet.</USER><BOT>I count as youd like a piece more bread, Dad?</BOT>
<USER>It goes to my heart to have a rose wasted on this business, John.</USER><BOT>Taint likely as you can get through courtship without parting with sommat, master.  Lucky if it baint gold as youre called upon to spill.</BOT>
<USER>Work?</USER><BOT>Work!  And yet tis a fine young lady as you do look in your muslin gown with silky ribbons to it and all.</BOT>
<USER>My good friend, youre wrong there, I was a poor country lad, but I had the greatest treasure that a man could hold on this earth.  Twas the love of my cousin Millie.  And being poor, I was put from out the home, and sent to seek my fortune in parts beyond the sea.</USER><BOT>Now, whod have thought twas so, for the looks of you be gentle born all over.</BOT>
<USER>Forget-me-nots, I mean.  And none but you to gather them for me, William.  Because - because - well, you do put me in thoughts of someone that I once held and now have lost.  Thats all.</USER><BOT>I didnt think to find you here, Isabel.</BOT>
<USER>I baint one for parlours, nor charms, maam.  I be here for another purpose.</USER><BOT>Now, my man, now, my wench - usll see what can be done with the victuals and drink theyve been and left.  Tis a fair heavy feed and drink as I do need.  Sommat asll lift me up through all the trials of this here foolish matrimony and stuff.</BOT>
<USER>I know you have, dear John.</USER><BOT>Cant you forget he what was false to you, days gone by, and take me as your husband now?</BOT>
<USER>Tis a fine looking lady, and that tis.  You take and court her, Master William.</USER><BOT>How am I to court the wench when shes not here?</BOT>
<USER>Look here, I could tell you, but I shant.</USER><BOT>If you have found it, Maggie, you may keep it.</BOT>
<USER>O, there you are.  Are you going out on the road afore tis got light?</USER><BOT>And that I be.  Tis very nigh to daybreak, so tis.</BOT>
<USER>O I promise, I promise - Ill just leave a crack of the door open for to hear well.</USER><BOT>No one will think that tisnt you, in the dusk.</BOT>
<USER>Hes a gentleman whats not cut out for courting, to my mind.</USER><BOT>Indeed he isnt, Nat.  And however the mistress got him dressed and set off on that business, I dont know.</BOT>
<USER>Her voice it was so clear.</USER><BOT>Long time I have been waiting for</BOT>
<USER>Then Ill leave you, Julia.  For things be stirring powerful in my mind too, and Id give sommat for to come to an understanding with they.  Ah, that I would.</USER><BOT>I sowed the seeds of love,</BOT>
<USER>He puts me in mind of - well - there, I cant recollect who tis.  [A knock is heard at the door.</USER><BOT>Go and see who tis, Lucy.</BOT>
<USER>Seeing that Ive given you leave to call me William tis only suitable that I should use your name as well.</USER><BOT>But my name is not Julia.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, depend on it, tis she.</USER><BOT>The young person do have all the looks of a serving wench, mistress.  She be tramping over the yard with naught but a white handkerchief over the head of she and a poking into most of the styes and a-calling of the geese and poultry.</BOT>
<USER>Thats about it.</USER><BOT>Well now, sister, usll have to ask the little Miss to help we.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, Andrew.  Tis so.  I never said it could be different.  I have no heart to give you.  My love was given long ago to another.  And that other has forgotten me by now.</USER><BOT>O Millie, you shall forget him too when once you are wed to me, I promise you.</BOT>
<USER>That I will not do.  I am going to think of yours.</USER><BOT>Im no better in my station than a serving maid, like Susan.</BOT>
<USER>You carry a handsome nosegay of blossoms there, John.  Are they from your masters garden?</USER><BOT>Ah, therere not amiss.  I helped for to raise they too.</BOT>
<USER>No.  But it does not seem quite so broad or so fine as I remembered it to be.  That is all.</USER><BOT>And very likely the house wont seem so fine neither, mistress, after the grand rooms which you have been used to.</BOT>
<USER>Ill do it, Gran.  Ill do it for your sake.  Tis very likely true what you do say, all of you.  Id but dance my feet off for naught.  When he came to look into my gipsy eyes, twould all be over and done with.</USER><BOT>quit</BOT>
<USER>Nothing of their swarming thick around her up in London, George?</USER><BOT>They may be swarming by the thousand for aught as I do know.  They smells gold as honey bees do smell the blossom.  Usll have a good few of them a-buzzing round the farm afore were many hours older, so I counts.</BOT>
<USER>Will you read it now, Aunt?</USER><BOT>Run away, little girl, I dont want no children worriting round me now.    I mean - no, my dear little girl, Id rather wait to read it till Im by myself; but thank you very kindly all the same, my pet.</BOT>
<USER>I hear her well enough, Gran.</USER><BOT>If youll teach me your dance against May Day.  Then, Ill clothe myself much after your fashion and dance upon the green with the rest.</BOT>
<USER>Stop a moment, Mother - stop a moment.  Maybe twont be so bad when Ive got more used to the idea.  Youve pitched it upon me so sudden like.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Rent day has pitched upon me more sudden, William.</BOT>
<USER>O John, Im a very poor judge of such things.</USER><BOT>And look you here.  I never seed a bit of Master Williams home-cured sent out beyond the family to no one till this day.  No, that I have not, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>I believe as Georgie knowed which of them was our aunt all the time.</USER><BOT>I believe it too.</BOT>
<USER>Anything more?</USER><BOT>I suppose youve put by a tidy bit - seeing as you be of a certain age.</BOT>
<USER>Never you mind, Annet - you shall see what tis to have a grand suitor and I shall get a little while of quiet out yonder, where I can think on Giles.</USER><BOT>Wheres Annet off to in such a hurry?</BOT>
<USER>But tis a thing that you do rare finely and well, John.  And tis you and none other who shall do the job for me this afternoon, there - thats what Ive come to in my thoughts.</USER><BOT>Master, master, whatever have you got in your head now?</BOT>
<USER>And wear my new frock whats ironed, and the beads what Miss Sims gived me.</USER><BOT>Im thinking as we shall get some snow by and bye.  Tis come over so dark all of a sudden.</BOT>
<USER>You may sit down, if you like, Mister Hooper.</USER><BOT>Ive been so bold as to bring you a little keepsake from my place in town, Missy.</BOT>
<USER>I want naught but my crust of bread.</USER><BOT>Ill fill your hands with gold pieces.</BOT>
<USER>Tis full of sounds.  Listen to the doves in the trees and the lambs calling from the meadow.</USER><BOT>Id sooner have the wheels of the coaches and the cries upon the street, and the door bell a ringing every moment and fine gentlemen and ladies being shewn up into the parlour.</BOT>
<USER>If tis a corpse, I guess herll have to wait till the dancings finished, then.</USER><BOT>Whos there?</BOT>
<USER>Thats it.  Now ladies, now Robert - tis thirsty work a-driving upon the Bristol road at midsummer.  Well lead off with a drink of home-made cider.  The eatingll come sweeter afterwards.</USER><BOT>Thats it, Miller.</BOT>
<USER>There, you dont need to come no further with I, Harry Moss.  You get on quick towards the town afore the night be upon you, and the snow, too.</USER><BOT>I dont care much about leaving you like this on the roadside, May.  And thats the truth, tis.</BOT>
<USER>Sunday clothes to the back of both of them.  And, when was Miss Clara expected up at home.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis a fair commotion all over these parts already, I warrant.  There wasnt nothing else spoke of in market last time, but how as sister Clara with all her money was to come home.</BOT>
<USER>Good morning, master.</USER><BOT>You mustnt mind a bit of an April shower, my boy.  Tis the way with all maids on their wedding morn.  Isnt that so, Mother?</BOT>
<USER>She should have come when twas meal time then.  I dont hold with bites nor drinks in between whiles.</USER><BOT>O Im dying for a glass of milk - or water would do as well.</BOT>
<USER>Our sight baint clear enough to do one for tother, the eyelets be made so small.</USER><BOT>Count as youll have to go unfastened then.</BOT>
<USER>Nor broke bread, nor scarce got a drop of drink to wet th insides of we.</USER><BOT>Tis very little further that you have got to journey, my good lads.  We are nigh to the end of our wayfaring.</BOT>
<USER>Tis as Steve do wish, but I be summat after a cow what has broke into the flower gardens, places where there be many folk got together and I among they.</USER><BOT>O, come, Mr. Davis!</BOT>
<USER>Hes gone off the place for a few minutes.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis early for the Red Bull.</BOT>
<USER>There, there they be!  Harken to them!  Tis with bells as they be coming out.  Bells whats ringing.  I count tis fine as May do look now in her marriage gown.  Harken, tis the bells a-shaking of the window pane.  I be an old woman, but the hearing of me baint spoiled.</USER><BOT>I warrant it baint, Missis.  Why, theyre ringing wonderful smart.  Tis enough, upon my word, for to fetch down every stone of the old place.</BOT>
<USER>Worse and worse.  Could I have dreamed both the music and the dance and the dancer?</USER><BOT>I am sure this was the case, my dear son.</BOT>
<USER>Im all ready dressed, except for my bonnet, Aunt.  Tis Millie thats like to keep Uncle waiting this morning.  [She goes out.</USER><BOT>Well, Mother - well, girls - but, bless my soul, wheres Millie got to?</BOT>
<USER>Gone off!</USER><BOT>who is gone off?</BOT>
<USER>And our fathers before us, Luke.</USER><BOT>And the courting of the same maid shall not come between us.</BOT>
<USER>I do like Miss Sims.  She do have nice things on her.  When I grows up Id like to look as she do, so I would.</USER><BOT>There, Mother, thatll do.  Id best put him on now.</BOT>
<USER>Lets while it away with a song or two.</USER><BOT>Good afternoon, Princess Royal Rags.  Are we to see you cutting capers before his lordship this afternoon?</BOT>
<USER>All right, Father, just you try your way - Ill have nothing more to do with it.</USER><BOT>Why, Father, youre back early from the Fair.</BOT>
<USER>Dont be so foolish, Thomas.  As if a man whats been stung by a wasp would care to sit himself down on a hornets nest.</USER><BOT>You are perfectly right, madam.  This is no place for me.  I have been sported with.  My good name has been treated as a jest.</BOT>
<USER>You are right there, Joan.  But now we must talk of your affairs.  Your fine courtiers will be coming in presently and you must know how to receive them in a good way.</USER><BOT>Thats what do hamper me dreadful, my speech and other things.  How would it be if you was to help me a little bit, like?</BOT>
<USER>Who said as I was upset, Rose?</USER><BOT>Look at the long face what youve pulled.  Annie, if twas me, I shouldnt much care about marrying a man with such a look to him.</BOT>
<USER>Ill never move till the hand that gathered these flowers be here to raise me.</USER><BOT>Ill sit here to the end of the world sooner nor go along to be wed with Miss over there.</BOT>
<USER>We shall want a bit of sunshine for the bride.</USER><BOT>That us shall, but it dont look much as though we should get it.</BOT>
<USER>That tis, mistress.  I put it back myself, and a good job for that taint went out of the family and off to the mouths of strangers, so says I.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Do you tend to Master Williams garden John, instead of talking.  Weve had enough of your tongue for one day.</BOT>
<USER>Youre about right, my true love, well get us off to the church.</USER><BOT>Ah, coach have been waiting a smartish while, I reckon.  Tis on master as expensell fall.</BOT>
<USER>Miles Hooper and Luke a-taking of the air, and of a weekday morning!</USER><BOT>That they was, master.  And they did stop I -</BOT>
<USER>Tis the place out of all the world to me.</USER><BOT>I count tis sommat rare and fine in that case, seeing as we be come from brave foreign parts, master.</BOT>
<USER>There are rough seats in the porch and in front of the window.  Bunches of leaves and herbs hang drying around door and window.  MARY is heard singing within.</USER><BOT>I sowed the seeds of Love,</BOT>
<USER>ut with the children and followed by MAGGIE.]</USER><BOT>Well, I never did meet with such goings on before.</BOT>
<USER>Millie, Ive set down my foot.</USER><BOT>And so have I, Father.</BOT>
<USER>Whats the rattle now, Kitty?  I declare I might be turning round on top of my own mill wheel such times as these.</USER><BOT>Rose says she wont wed Robert, and Roberts gone off his head all along of that naughty servant maid.</BOT>
<USER>And was it ever true that I did sit through a long Sunday her hand in mine?  [Another silence.</USER><BOT>But hows us ever to get out of the caddle where we be?</BOT>
<USER>Shes got old enough to be put to service, and if Id have had my way, tis to service shed have gone this long time since, and that it is.</USER><BOT>Twould be poor work putting one of dead sisters wenches out to service, so long as us have a roof over the heads of we and plenty to eat on the table.</BOT>
<USER>Anything to oblige you, my young lord.</USER><BOT>Take out a handful from the bag of gold.  And you, John, give him some of the silver.</BOT>
<USER>No, John - No, Ive had enough of that for my life time.</USER><BOT>So have I, master, and more nor enough.  I dont care particular if I never set eyes on a maid again.</BOT>
<USER>Tis fiery dry to my thinking.</USER><BOT>I have no flowers to take to church with me, William; go you to the waterside, I have a mind to carry some of the blue things what grow there.</BOT>
<USER>Well my boy, well Millie?</USER><BOT>Tis for a month from now.</BOT>
<USER>O I cant believe in this.  Tis too good to be true, and that it be - A fine gentleman as Robert be now and a poor little wretch like me!</USER><BOT>Tis but a foolish dream like.  How are folks like us to get mixing and messing with the drinks of they?  Time was when I did sit and eat along of them at the table, the same as one of theirselves.  But now!  Why, theyd take and hound me away from the door.</BOT>
<USER>Tis rare smart as I be feeling, Mother.  Im all a kind of a dazzle within of me, same as tis with the sun upon the snow out yonder.</USER><BOT>Why, look you, theres George a-coming up the path already.</BOT>
<USER>And a grand thing to have your victuals spread afore you each time stead of having to go lean very often.</USER><BOT>O, a handful of berries and a drink of fresh water is enough for me.</BOT>
<USER>Come Mother, come Andrew, I be sharp set.  And tis the feel of victuals and no words as I wants in my mouth.</USER><BOT>Well, Father, Im not detaining you.  Theres the door, and the food has been cooling on the table this great while.</BOT>
<USER>It would appear that your business was with me, then?</USER><BOT>Ah, youve hit the right nail, mistress.  Tis with you.  Tis a straight offer as my master have sent me out for to make.</BOT>
<USER>As for me, the only food I require is the sweet honey of my Missys voice.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis a grand thing to be a young man, Miles Hooper.  There was a day when such things did come handy to my tongue, like.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, there you are, Father.</USER><BOT>But I reckon as the little maid will hearken to what I says.  Her was always a wonderful good little maid to her dad.  And her did always know, that when her dad did set his foot down, well, there twas.  Twas down.</BOT>
<USER>Ill be off and help master.  Ive been and put the meat on to boil as you said, missis.</USER><BOT>We dont care much about our new aunt, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Kitty be going to live along of them at Bristol too, after a while.</USER><BOT>Then I count as it might feel a bit desolate like in this great house alone.</BOT>
<USER>Come along then Master William.  You can leave the spring vegetables to she.  Tis more nor she deserves, seeing as her might have known as twas her mistress the both of us was after, all the time.</USER><BOT>O John, this courting, tis powerful heavy work.</BOT>
<USER>Why, George, my lad.</USER><BOT>Yes, Master Thomas.</BOT>
<USER>I could never find it in my heart to - I mean, tis as well that you should get used to blows, seeing were to be wed, Andrew.</USER><BOT>Then tis to be!  O Millie, this is brave news - Why, I do scarcely know whether I be awake or dreaming.</BOT>
<USER>And was there naught for Dad in the great box?</USER><BOT>Perhaps there may be.</BOT>
<USER>Youre a sad ungrateful girl.  Why, theres many would give their eyes to change with you.</USER><BOT>But out here tis all peace, and freedom.  Theres naught calling out to be done.  The flowers grow as they like, and the breezes move them this way, and that.  The ground is thick with leaves and blossoms and no one has got to sweep it, and the hard things with great noises to them, like pails and churns, are far away and clean forgot.</BOT>
<USER>What are you called, my girl?</USER><BOT>Isabel is my name, but Id sooner you called me Lucy.</BOT>
<USER>O Susan, them be grand words.</USER><BOT>But then again - I do think as you be getting too much like Master William.</BOT>
<USER>Theres nothing to make so much trouble about, sir.</USER><BOT>Can we be of any assistance to you, madam?  The wood may appear rather dense at this point.</BOT>
<USER>Tis from hearing all the family.  But, dear Miles, promise there shant be nothing but - but love talk between you and me this day.  I could not bear it if we was to speak of, of other things, like.</USER><BOT>As you will - as you will.  Anything to oblige a lady.</BOT>
<USER>No, Dorry, tisnt for me.</USER><BOT>You just ask her for whom it is, then, Dorry.</BOT>
<USER>There, tis nothing to make such a commotion of!  Just a flower - see, Mr. Davis?  I knowed as it was one what you was partial to, and so I just brought it along with me.</USER><BOT>That there baint for I, be it?</BOT>
<USER>O, that I do, Father.</USER><BOT>Yon great ones for you, Mill.</BOT>
<USER>O, tis wonderful modish.  I declare I never did see anything to beat it up in town.</USER><BOT>Now I thought as much.  I flatter myself that we can hold our own with the best of them in Painswick High Street.</BOT>
<USER>Mistress havent told you - havent she?  Well - well - at such a time we must all - all rejoice one with tother, like.  No difference made twixt master and man.  Nor twixt maid and missus.  Down at the far end of the table you can sit yourselves, my wenches.  Up against George - Hows that?</USER><BOT>That will do very well for us, Master.</BOT>
<USER>Ah - twas afore - afore our courting time, Emily.</USER><BOT>Prime weather for the hay, farmer.  I count as this dry will last until the whole of it be carried.  [A knock is heard at the door.</BOT>
<USER>So you be comed back, May.  I always knowed as you would.</USER><BOT>How did you know twas me, then?</BOT>
<USER>My place, my place!  Wheres that I want to know!  Tis another whats got into the nest now, to lie snug and warm within.  And tis for I to spread the wings of me and to go out into the storm again.  So tis.</USER><BOT>Get you to Steve, May, and let him but look on the form of you and on the bloom, and usll see what he will do with tother hussy then.  Ah, they sneaking, mealy wenches what have got fattened up and licked over by th old woman till tis queens as they fancies theirselves, you shall tell they summat about what they be, come morning.  And your poor old mother, herll speak, too, what hasnt been let sound her tongue these years gone by.  Ah, hern shall know what us do think of they, hern shall squat upon the floor and hear the truth.</BOT>
<USER>Just so.  But here he comes, poor misguided youth.</USER><BOT>No, no - that was not the music of it, that was not the dance - not a face among them resembles the image I carry in my heart.</BOT>
<USER>You couldnt beat these nowhere, not if you were to try.</USER><BOT>Im sure you could not, master.</BOT>
<USER>And that us will, if our new gowns baint hooked too tight for we to bend.</USER><BOT>Mary, I never thought to see such a thing as this.</BOT>
<USER>We have perches and plenty of them for barn door poultry, but when it comes to roosting spangled plumes and fancy fowls, no thank you, Thomas, Im not going to do it.</USER><BOT>Do let us get and roost some fancy fowls, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>Be you a-going up to Steve now?</USER><BOT>No, I baint.  Tis out from here that I be going.  And back on to the road.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a fine thing to fetch up May this evening, that tis.  May, what went out trolloping along the roads stead of she biding at home to mind the house and child!  Tis how you did breed she up, Vashti Reed, what led her to act as her did.  And if youd have bred her different, twould have been all the same; for whats in the blood is bound to out and show; and when you picks a weed and sets it in the room, taint no flower as you must look for.</USER><BOT>Tis summat like a twelve year since her went.  But in the blinking of an eye the latch might be raised, and she come through the door again.  God bless the head an feet of she!</BOT>
<USER>Now, Jeremy, sister and me baint going off all alone.</USER><BOT>No further than the church door, I say.  Ive better things to do nor a-giving of my arm to females be they never so full of wiles.  And you two do beat many what baint near so long in the tusk, ah, that you does.</BOT>
<USER>And never seed no more of them, nor sent to say how twas with you, nor nothing?</USER><BOT>Nor nothing, Harry.  Went out and shut the door behind me.  And twas finished.</BOT>
<USER>Well, well, - have it your own way - but I always says, and my father used to say it afore I, a fine deed do call for a fine drink, and thats how twas in my time.</USER><BOT>Millie, do you call your cousins in to supper.</BOT>
<USER>How be things going at the Mill to-day, Jerry?</USER><BOT>Powerful bad.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Master John - well, mistress?</USER><BOT>Master was just starting out for to fetch you home, Jerry.</BOT>
<USER>JOHN, his farm hand.</USER><BOT>SUSAN, their maid.</BOT>
<USER>Well, tis a cold finish to a hot life.</USER><BOT>They took and laid her on the grass, Steve, as I comed by.</BOT>
<USER>And thatll not be till this day next year if this sort of thing goes on any longer.</USER><BOT>Thats right, Mother.  You take and lead the way.  Tis the womenfolk as do keep we back from everything.  But I knows how to settle with they -  - come Mill, come Giles, Andrew, Annet, May.  Come Mother, out of th house with all of you and to church, I say.</BOT>
<USER>Tisnt only May, Aunt, I do love to hear what uncle tells, when he has been out for a day or two.</USER><BOT>And did you have company on the way home, Father?</BOT>
<USER>Let the maid fill your mug again, my dear one.</USER><BOT>I dont mind if I do have another swill.</BOT>
<USER>I warrant you will, you clown.  But let me advise you to look better afore you leap next time, or very likely tis in sommat worse than a ditchful of nettles as youll find yourself.</USER><BOT>I reckon as youve no call to trouble about we, mistress.  Us is they what can look after theirselves very well.  Suppose you was to wash your face and dry your eyes and set about the boiling of yon spring cabbage.  Twould be sensibler like nor to bide grizzling after one as is beyond you in his station, so twould.</BOT>
<USER>O, Im sure, from all I hear, as she had nothing to grumble at, Steve.</USER><BOT>And there came a fearsome thought, too, Annie, as you might go the same way through not getting on comfortable with me, and me being so much older nor you, and such-like.  Annie, I couldnt bear for it to happen so, I could not.  For I holds to having you aside of me always stronger nor I holds to anything else in the world, and I could not stand it if twas as I should lose you.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Rent day has pitched upon me more sudden, William.</USER><BOT>he he</BOT>
<USER>My goodness, Susan, what are you thinking of?  Say naught, but that Im coming.  Run away now, and run quickly.  [SUSAN goes off.</USER><BOT>What are you going to do now, Julia?</BOT>
<USER>O Uncle, that must have been a beautiful animal!  And what was the tail of it?</USER><BOT>The tail, my little maid?  Why twas longer nor my arm and as thick again - twould have served as a bell rope to the great bell yonder in Gloucester church - and so twould.  Ah, twas sommat like a tail, I reckon, yon.</BOT>
<USER>To church, Father?</USER><BOT>Ah, that tis - you in the cloak and bonnet, and upon the arm of young Andrew, my wench.</BOT>
<USER>Mother wont let me talk with you any more, alone.  She says as youve made a fool of Georgie and youll do the same by us all.</USER><BOT>There now, how did I do that, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Twould have been a pity to have wasted the fresh blossoms.</USER><BOT>But they were gathered for you, Mill.</BOT>
<USER>Tisnt too late, by a long way, master.</USER><BOT>And so I would crave something of you, old friend.  Lend me your smock, and your big hat and your staff.  In that disguise I will go to the farm and look upon my poor false love once more.  If I find that her heart is already given to another, I shall not make myself known to her.  But if she still holds to her love for me, then -</BOT>
<USER>I think weve all had quite enough of Millies tongue, Father.  Let her give it a rest if sheve a mind.</USER><BOT>I warrant she be gone as shy as a May bettel when tis daylight.  But usll take it as she have fixed it up in her own mind like.  Come, Mother, such a time as this, you wont take no objection to the drawing of a jug of cider.</BOT>
<USER>There, there - you shall go and well say no more about it.</USER><BOT>I never knowed you give in to her so foolish like this afore, Steve.</BOT>
<USER>Why, theres Susan coming.</USER><BOT>So that is Susan?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, I am lending myself to all this, because I, too, have something to win or lose.</USER><BOT>Where did you meet him, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Tis the eating and drinking as do play most heavily upon my mind, mistress.</USER><BOT>Then think of these words as you sit at table.  Eat as though you were not hungry and drink as though there were no such thing as thirst.  Let your hands move about your plate as if they were too tired to lift the knife and fork.</BOT>
<USER>Let them look.  Id give a good bit for all the world to see us now.</USER><BOT>O, whatever do you mean by that, Mister Robert?</BOT>
<USER>Wheres the little maid got to?  George and me be come up from the field on purpose for to bid her welcome home.</USER><BOT>Miss is still at her toilet, farmer.</BOT>
<USER>You be speaking foolishness.  What do you know of him - what do us blind worms know about the stars above we?</USER><BOT>I seed him pass by upon his horse one day.  All there was of him did shine like the sun upon the water - I was very near dazed by the brightness.  So I was.</BOT>
<USER>No, mam.</USER><BOT>You should have told them the truth about yourself at once.</BOT>
<USER>No.  This is another.  Folk do marvel how Miller John do have the patience to keep in with him.</USER><BOT>Hows that?</BOT>
<USER>Now, my little maid, off you go.  Take back the tray to Mother, and be careful as you dont break the glasses on it.</USER><BOT>Im off to play in the hayfield along of Robin, then.</BOT>
<USER>Who asked you to speak?  Get you upstairs and pull your mistress out of bed - and curl the ringlets of her hair and dust the flour on to her face.  Tis about all you be fit for.</USER><BOT>Very well.  Tis best that I should go.  I might say something you would not like.</BOT>
<USER>There, Father, - perhaps youll believe what I tell you another time.  Millie has got that hardened and wayward, theres no managing of her, theres not.</USER><BOT>Ah, twont be very long as usll have the managing of she.  Twill be young Andrew asll take she in hand after this day.</BOT>
<USER>Id keep my breath for when twas wanted, if twas me.</USER><BOT>Come, look I in the face, Harry Moss, and tell I if so be as theyll be likely to know I again up at home?</BOT>
<USER>So that I should scarce know she.</USER><BOT>She have brought Mother a silken gown and me a string of coral beads.  But naught for you, Georgie.</BOT>
<USER>Theres always been enough for you and me so far, Mother.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Ah, but that wont last for ever.  Im got an old woman, and I cant do with the dairy nor the poultry as I was used to do.  And things have not the same prices to them as twas a few years gone by.  And last years season was the worst that I remember.</BOT>
<USER>There - Id not change this for a thousand sacks of gold - I swear Id not.</USER><BOT>Now Robert - get up, the two of you.  Are you bewitched or sommat - O Jerry, stir them, cant you.</BOT>
<USER>And a finer or a richer gentleman I never want to see.</USER><BOT>Do you hear that, Father?  O you shocking liars - tis stolen goods that youve been and brought to our innocent house this day.  But, Father, do you up and fetch in the constable, do you hear?</BOT>
<USER>Millies got quite changed towards me since last time.</USER><BOT>And when was that, Andrew?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, twasnt much as we could do for the likes of she - what was a regular roadster.  Bad herbs, all of them.  And if it hadnt been so as twas my wedding eve, this one shouldnt have set foot inside of the house.  But tis a season when a mans took a bit soft and foolish, like, the night afore his marriage.  Baint that so, George?</USER><BOT>And when was it, Steve, as she went off from here?</BOT>
<USER>They are fresh and bright for I brushed and shook them myself this morning.</USER><BOT>I have taken a dislike to them.  See here, Joan, since you admire them, they shall be yours.</BOT>
<USER>Usll see no Camel Farm this day.</USER><BOT>And th inside of I be crying out for victuals.</BOT>
<USER>What has happened, John?</USER><BOT>Ill tell you in a couple of words, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Along of Andrew?  Girls, you may now go outside into the garden for a while.  Yes, put aside your work.</USER><BOT>Cant we stop till the packets are opened?</BOT>
<USER>The ladys coming along ever so quickly, master.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Youll please to come indoors with me, William, and Ill brush you down and make you look more presentable than you appear just now.  Susan, youll get a cap to you head at once, do you hear me!  And John, take and water masters seedlings.  Any one can stand with their mouths open and their eyes as big as gooseberries if theyve a mind.  Tis not particular sharp to do so.  Come, William.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, and that you can.  You have got to run quickly back to the farm.</USER><BOT>Be it got terrible late, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Ill not have the food kept back any longer for Luke Jenner.  If folk cant come to the time when theyre asked, they baint worth waiting for, so sit you down, all of you.</USER><BOT>You need not think youre to be helped first, Clara, for all that the party is given for you, like.  The poor little children have been kept waiting a sad time for their supper, first because you was such a while a having your head curled and puffed out, and then twas Luke Jenner as didnt come.</BOT>
<USER>No, us be comed from right over the seas, along of master.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis a fine gentleman, master.  But powerful misfortunate in things of the heart.</BOT>
<USER>From whom did you take the manner and the colour of your garments, my maid?</USER><BOT>Perhaps you have a tongue in your head.  From whom did you try to learn those steps?</BOT>
<USER>And what next, I should like to know?</USER><BOT>Tis only a drink of water that Im asking for.</BOT>
<USER>There was summat in the fashion her was laid, Steve, as drawed I near for to get a sight of the face of she.</USER><BOT>Well, I shouldnt have much cared for that, George.</BOT>
<USER>This nosegay - and look, those young carrots - and the turnips and beans, why did you bring them for me, master, unless it was that you intended something by it?</USER><BOT>Thats so.  So tis.  Thats true.  I count you have got hold of the sow by the ear right enough this time.  And the less said about it the better.  [A slight silence.</BOT>
<USER>O, Granma, it was beautiful, I could have stopped all night, I could.  We comed away early cause Miss Sims, she said as the dancing gived her the headache, but the New Year hant been danced in yet, it hant.</USER><BOT>You get and dance off to bed, Dorry, thats what youve got to do - and quickly.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, I warrant as herll need a smartish bit of time for to take the creases out of the face of she.</USER><BOT>Well, Andrew, my lad, tis about time as we was on the way to church I reckon.</BOT>
<USER>Let them be found.  Let them be brought back at once.</USER><BOT>For my part Im glad theyve gone off.  The girl was a wild, bad thing.  I saw how she went on with Robert.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats a thing I do well understand, Mister Hooper.</USER><BOT>I loved you from the first, Miss.  Theres the true, high born lady for you, says I to myself.  Theres beauty and style, elegance and refinement.</BOT>
<USER>And we was wishing as wed never left home to come among all these stranger folk.</USER><BOT>Not that we feels you to be a stranger, dear Mister Jeremy.</BOT>
<USER>O, I could rest more sweetly on the grass and moss yonder.</USER><BOT>I did never sleep within four walls but once, and then twas in gaol.</BOT>
<USER>Thank you.  Thomas.  One of your sisters is about enough.</USER><BOT>Hark you here, mistress.  Theres many a cloudy morning turns out a sunshiny day.  Baint that a true saying, Joan?</BOT>
<USER>That may be so, yet twasnt as such I had figured she in the eye of my mind, like.  [There is a moments silence.</USER><BOT>George, my boy, you and sister Clara used to be up to rare games one with tother once on a time.    There, my wench, I count youve not forgotten Georgie?</BOT>
<USER>And thats how tis with I, too, Annie.  Tis as though I was out in the meadows, like - And as though twere Sunday, and such a stillness all around that I might think twas only me as was upon the earth.  But then summat stirs in me sudden and I knows that you be there, too, and tis my love for you what has put me right away from the rest of them.</USER><BOT>Steve, youve had a poor, rough time, I know, but Ill do my best for to smooth it like for you, I will.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, you must let me send you up one from my place during your stay here.  Who could expect a lady to drink from such a thing as that?</USER><BOT>Theres a taste of mould in the water too.</BOT>
<USER>That I will, master.</USER><BOT>John, Im powerful upset.</BOT>
<USER>Hark you, Steve.  Tis on my mind to ask summat of you.  Did you have much speech with the poor thing what you took in from the snow last night?</USER><BOT>No, George, and that I didnt.  Her was mostly in a kind of drunken sleep all the time, and naught to be got out from she.  Mother, her tried.  But twas like trying to get water from the pump yonder, when tis froze.</BOT>
<USER>The war has been known to turn many a brain.</USER><BOT>And yet my son holds his own with the brightest intelligences of the day.</BOT>
<USER>I do feel so awkward like in speech with Farmer Thomas, mistress.  And with the children, too.</USER><BOT>Come, you must take heart and throw yourself into the acting.  Try to be as a sister would with Thomas.  Be lively, and kind in your way with the children.</BOT>
<USER>Upon my word, but something must be done to bring these goings on to an end.</USER><BOT>Come, Nat - you shall tell me all your trouble.  I understand the things of the heart better than Tansie, and I shall know how to give you comfort in your distress - come</BOT>
<USER>I have, mistress.  Whilst they was a packing up the poultry in my basket.  Down at the Bull.</USER><BOT>What sort of a maid is it?</BOT>
<USER>There - Steve, I cant get it out, I cant.</USER><BOT>Then let it bide in.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER is knitting in the Arbour.  WILLIAM strolls about gloomily, his hands in his pockets.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  And serve you right, William, for sending the man when you should have gone yourself.</BOT>
<USER>I wish it was to-morrow now, Granma, I do.  Shall you put on your Sunday gown first thing, or wait till just afore we goes to church?</USER><BOT>How your tongue do go!  Take and bide quiet a bit, if you knows how.</BOT>
<USER>Come, wouldnt you have done the same?</USER><BOT>That I should not, Julia.</BOT>
<USER>Then you could have sworn wrong.  I care nothing for you, Andrew, no, nothing.  But I gave my word Id go to church with you and be wed.  And - Ill not break my word, Ill not.</USER><BOT>And is this all that you can say to me to-day, Mill?</BOT>
<USER>Twasnt Roberts fault, I know.  Twas the maid off the road who started it.</USER><BOT>Jeremy - Jeremy - come you in here a minute.</BOT>
<USER>Come, George, usll clear out down to th hay field, and snatch a bite as we do go.</USER><BOT>Thats it, master.</BOT>
<USER>Then send him in.  But do you run quickly, Miss Clara, and keep Miles Hooper from the farmer.</USER><BOT>Ill run my best, never fear.  [She goes out.</BOT>
<USER>O May - you say she did recollect herself - what do you mean by those words?</USER><BOT>You see, she did give her word that she would speak sharp and rough to you.</BOT>
<USER>Such a house I never heard tell of.  Ring, ring at the bell and no one to come nigh.</USER><BOT>Being unused to bells, sister, maybe as us did pull them wrong or sommat.</BOT>
<USER>Well, my wench - you be tricked out as though you was off to the horse show.  Mother, there baint no one as can beat our wench in looks anywhere this side of the country.</USER><BOT>Shes right enough in the clothing of her, but twould be better if her looks did match the garments more.  Come, Millie, cant you appear pleasanter like on your wedding day?</BOT>
<USER>Was you calling, mistress?</USER><BOT>Whats this youve got saying to Miss Jessie, I should like to know.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and so you did, master.</USER><BOT>And theres from where I took the Early Snowballs.</BOT>
<USER>Now hark you to this, Andrew, and turn it well over in your mind.  [She begins to sing:</USER><BOT>Say can you plough me an acre of land</BOT>
<USER>I spoke as you do, once.  My lover passed me by for another.  A man may give all his love to the gilly flower, but tis the scarlet rose as takes his fancy come to-morrow.</USER><BOT>And has your heart recovered from its sickness, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Before that, and now, master.</USER><BOT>And now, John?</BOT>
<USER>May, what are you a-doing here I should like to know?  Didnt I send you out into the garden along of your sister?</USER><BOT>Yes, Auntie, but Ive comed back.</BOT>
<USER>Annet!</USER><BOT>There, father, come along down and give your face a wash at the pump.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  See here, John - suppose you were to let your tongue bide still in its home awhile, and start doing something with your hands.</USER><BOT>Thats right enough, mistress.  Whats wanted, Master William?</BOT>
<USER>Tis nigh to home as I be, Harry.</USER><BOT>Then get and stand up out of the wet grass there, and Ill go along of you a bit further.  Twill not be much out of my way.  Nothing to take no count of.</BOT>
<USER>Such a strange room.  So very common.</USER><BOT>Nay, you mustnt judge of the house by this.  Dont you recollect the parlour yonder, with the stuffed birds and the chiney cupboard?</BOT>
<USER>Come, Emily.</USER><BOT>I was kept waiting while they did pluck and dress the chicken.</BOT>
<USER>No, Harry, they did not.</USER><BOT>And where was it you did go to, May, once you was out and the door shut ahind of you?</BOT>
<USER>No, no - it isnt that.  Ill gladly do them.  Come, Miss Jessie, you will shew me if I do them wrongly, wont you?</USER><BOT>O yes, Ill help you because I like you, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>He pulled them, every one, with his own hands, Julia.</USER><BOT>My love has gathered something better for me than a carrot.  See, a spray of elder bloom that was tossing ever so high in the wind.</BOT>
<USER>No, nor wanted for to, neither.</USER><BOT>There was naught to make you think of -</BOT>
<USER>That wont hurt you - a tiny caterpillar.</USER><BOT>What more could the farm hand do, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Twouldnt be half the upset if the wench was coming by herself, but to have a hussy of a serving maid sticking about in the rooms along of us, is more nor I can stand.</USER><BOT>Hark, whats that, mother?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, poor beggar, he would, and no mistake.</USER><BOT>I warrant as Emily do keep it afore him as how he was took in from off the road by th old farmer in his day.</BOT>
<USER>Tis all took out of my hands now, I can but do as your lordship says.  Jockie, play me my music, and play it bravely too.</USER><BOT>I wonder if the young person understands that my poor boy is a little touched in the brain?</BOT>
<USER>There was never a moment when I did not know my own mind, John.  And thats the truth.</USER><BOT>Well, us wont say no more about that.  Taint fit as there should be ill feeling nor quarrelling twixt me and you.</BOT>
<USER>Right what, Robert?</USER><BOT>I hardly know what I was a-going to say, Rose.  Suppose you was to take up your flowers and go to dress yourself.  We might as well get it all over and finished with.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Susan?  As idle a piece of goods as ever was seen on a summers day!  No.  Tisnt a serving maid that I was thinking of, but someone who should be of more account in the house.  Tis a daughter that Im wanting, William, and Ive picked out the one who is to my taste.</USER><BOT>Then youve done more than I have, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>He must have his little joke, sister, man-like, you know.</USER><BOT>Jerry, and Ive been seeking you everywhere.  Come you off to the yard.  Tis as much as we shall do to be ready afore church time.  I never knew you to idle in the house afore.</BOT>
<USER>Theres chairs right in front of you.</USER><BOT>Maybe as youd like my kitchen wench to come and do that for you, Clara, seeing as your fine maid is gadding about the high roads instead of minding what it concerns her to attend to.</BOT>
<USER>Millie, do you call your cousins in to supper.</USER><BOT>no, i wont do taht</BOT>
<USER>Th old thing may as well bide the night now she be come.  Hark you, Vashti, twill save you the journey down to-morrow like, if you bides the night, and the chimney corner is all as you ever wants.</USER><BOT>And what should I be journeying down to-morrow for, Jane Browning?</BOT>
<USER>Can I get you an old sack or summat for to cover you up a bit this cold night?</USER><BOT>All right.  You can just bide where you be on the settle.  Tis warmer within nor upon the road to-night, and Ill come and let you out when tis morning.</BOT>
<USER>Indeed I have, and I think I must have lost it in the hayfield.</USER><BOT>Taint lost.</BOT>
<USER>Get along of you, Gran, tis for the dance up at the school as they be come.</USER><BOT>Come you here - her whats to wed our Steve.  Come you here and let I look at you.  My eyes baint so quick as they was once.  Many tears have clouded they.  But come you here.</BOT>
<USER>And get it all creased up afore to-morrow!  Whatever next!  You go and lay it on the bed this minute, do you hear?</USER><BOT>Id like to put it on just once, I would.</BOT>
<USER>No - wait till you and Robert are made man and wife, Rose.  Then twont matter quite so much.</USER><BOT>Ill never wed me to Robert, Ill only wed me to him who gathered these blue flowers here.</BOT>
<USER>You shut up, George.  Heres Annie with Rose a-coming up to the door.  Dont you get saying another word about yon poor wretch nor the end of her.  I wouldnt have my Annie upset for all the world to-day.  Tis a thing as must not be spoke of afore they, nor Dorry neither, do you hear?</USER><BOT>Hold back, Steve, a minute.  Theres summat more as Ive got to say.</BOT>
<USER>Ill learn anyone to come meddling with me on a day when tis marrying going on.</USER><BOT>No, no.  Tis I who will open the door.</BOT>
<USER>Im not deaf, Father.</USER><BOT>Ah my boy, I knowed as youd bring the little maid to the senses of she.</BOT>
<USER>Do you sit a-nigh me, May.  The night be a wild one.  I would not have you be on the roads.</USER><BOT>O, the roads be fine on nights when the tempest moves in the trees above and the rain falls into the mouth of you and lies with a good taste on your tongue.  And you goes quick on through it till you comes to where the lights do blink, and tis a large town and there be folk moving this way and that and the music playing, and great fowls and horses whats got clocks to the inside of they, a-stirring them up for to run, and girls and men a-riding on them - And the booths with red sugar and white, all lit and animals thats wild a-roaring and a-biting in the tents - And girls whats dancing, standing there in satin gowns all over gold and silver - And you walks to and fro in it all and tis good to be there and free - And tis better to be in such places and to come and to go where you have a mind than to be cooped in here, with th old woman and all - Tis a fine life as you lives on the roads - and tis a better one nor this, I can tell you, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>Ill see that youre not kept waiting, Jeremy.</USER><BOT>What be they called, Mary?</BOT>
<USER>Then gentlemen, do you walk a bit of the road with me and we could enjoy some conversation as we go along.</USER><BOT>You take my arm, Miss Clara - do - .</BOT>
<USER>O, get on, Mr. Davis!  I dont believe half what you do say, no more does Annie.</USER><BOT>If Mr. Davis dont know how to dance right, youre the one to learn him, Rose.  Come, Dorry, you take hold of my hand, and Ill look after you on the way.  Good-night, Mrs. Browning.  Good-night, Mrs. Reed.</BOT>
<USER>Miss Clara.  Tell me what is going on.    Why have you dressed yourself like this?</USER><BOT>Come, come.  There seems to be some sort of a hitch here.  The young gentleman has very likely stopped a bit too long at the Spotted Cow on his way up.</BOT>
<USER>Is he too sick to come and plead his cause himself, John?</USER><BOT>Ah, and that he be.  Do go moulting about the place with his victuals left upon the dish - a sighing and a grizzling so that any maid whats got a heart to th inside of she would be moved in pity, did she catch ear of it, and would lift he out of the torment.</BOT>
<USER>And be we to come up to the farm when we hears you?</USER><BOT>As quickly as you can run.  Twill be the sign that I need all of you with me.</BOT>
<USER>Them be good words, Annie, and no mistake.</USER><BOT>And what you feels about the days gone by dont count, Steve, cause they baint true of you.  You was always a kind husband, and from what Ive hear-ed folks say, she was one as wasnt never suited to neither you nor yours.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, hes a man to anyones liking, sister.</USER><BOT>Tis homelike as he do make I to feel among all these strangers.</BOT>
<USER>Start courting, master.</USER><BOT>O I dare not quite so sudden, John.</BOT>
<USER>Know how it feels.  Look here - Tis sick to death I am with courting, when tis from the wrong quarter, and if Im to wed Andrew come next month, Ill not be tormented with him before that time, - so tis you that shall stop and talk with him this evening, Annet, and Ill slip out to the woods and gather flowers.</USER><BOT>How wild and unlikely you do talk, Mill.</BOT>
<USER>I be the only girl as have stopped with you more nor a month, I be.  Tothers wouldnt bide a day, some of them.</USER><BOT>Be quiet.  Back to your work with you.  And when the hay is all carried, off with you, ungrateful minx, to where you came from.</BOT>
<USER>Her was as quiet as a new born lamb once the door was broke open and she did see as my word, well, twas my word.</USER><BOT>We all hear a great deal about your word, Father, but twould be better for there to be more do and less say about you.</BOT>
<USER>Twas that they mistook I for another.  And when the morning did come, they did let I go again.</USER><BOT>I count twas a smartish long night, that!</BOT>
<USER>Miss Clara, it seems that there is nothing more to be said.</USER><BOT>And thats the most sensible thing as has been spoke this long while.  Thomas, your sister favours you in being a poor, grizzling sort of a muddler.  She might have took up with this young man, who has a very respectable appearance.</BOT>
<USER>No, no, what was I a-saying to you?  The dark must fall and cover me, or I wont never go across the field nor a-nigh the house.  Give I to drink, give I to drink.  And then let me bide in quiet till all of the light be gone.</USER><BOT>Where be I to find drink, and the frost lying stiff upon the ground?</BOT>
<USER>You must be sisterly with Thomas.</USER><BOT>Id clean forgot him.  I dont doubt but what hell ferret out the truth in no time.</BOT>
<USER>That she baint, the old drinking gipsy - tis at the spirits as her got in the night - and put away very near the best part of a bottle.  Now shes best left to sleep it off, she be.</USER><BOT>Come on, George.  Come, Dorry.</BOT>
<USER>What be I to say, Rose?</USER><BOT>Well, something of how you thinks she looks, of course.</BOT>
<USER>Gentlemen as was after courting you, mistress.</USER><BOT>Courting me?</BOT>
<USER>O Lubin - a poor serving maid like I am.</USER><BOT>Ill have no one else in the whole world.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Emily; well, Luke.  I didnt think to lose my little sister afore shed stopped a three days in the place.  That I did not.  But I dont grudge her to a fine prospering young man like friend Hooper, no, I dont.</USER><BOT>No one called upon you for a speech, Thomas.  See if you cant make yourself of some use in passing the green stuff.    We have two serving maids and a man, Mister Jenner, but theyre to be allowed to act the quality to-day, so weve got to wait upon ourselves.</BOT>
<USER>As how twould feel to be a real grand lady, like you, mistress.</USER><BOT>What then, Joan?</BOT>
<USER>Those flowers are dying.  My fancy ones were best.</USER><BOT>Here they are, dear Rose.</BOT>
<USER>O dear Robert!</USER><BOT>Youve got my fancy more than ever, Rose.</BOT>
<USER>I have that to say which would not bide till sunset, Miss Clara.</USER><BOT>Indeed, Mister Jenner.  I wonder what that can be.</BOT>
<USER>Joan dont eat like that, Mister Hooper.</USER><BOT>Joans only a maid servant, Miss Jessie.  You should learn to distinguish between such people and fine ladles like your aunt.</BOT>
<USER>Dear me, tis warm.</USER><BOT>I hope my face dont show mottled, sister?</BOT>
<USER>Well, master, thats a thing to ask a man!</USER><BOT>Tis a terrible serious matter, John.  Did you ever go?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, but when theres been no meeting in the dusk since Sunday, and no message sent!</USER><BOT>Keep that tongue of yourn where it should be, and give over, Tansie.  Susans not one as would play tricks with her lad.</BOT>
<USER>O Andrew, I never was given anything like this before.</USER><BOT>I should like to give you a great deal more, Annet - only I cannot.  And tis got too late.</BOT>
<USER>I feared twas so with you, Millie.</USER><BOT>O Ive laid awake of nights and my tears have wetted the pillow all over so that Ive had to turn it tother side up.</BOT>
<USER>Im mortal afeared of cows, mistress.  I could never abide the sight nor the sound of those animals.</USER><BOT>Youll soon get over that, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>O twas such beautiful times as we did have down by the riverside, him and me.</USER><BOT>She would sit, her hand in mine by the hour of a Sunday afternoon.</BOT>
<USER>Be quiet, May.  Cant you all see how tis.  Giles has done the cruel hard task set him by Father - and is back again with the bushel of silver and that of gold to claim my hand.    But Giles - Id have given it to you had you come to me poor and forlorn and ragged, for my love has never wandered from you in all this long time.</USER><BOT>No, Giles - and that it has not.  Millie has never given me one kind word nor one gentle look all the years that Ive been courting of her, and thats the truth.  And you can call witness to it if you care.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis best to be finished with hearts that beat to the tune of a maids tongue, and to creep quiet along the roads with naught but them pains as hunger and thirst do bring to th inside.  So tis.</USER><BOT>- Scene 1.</BOT>
<USER>O I cannot see him - Im wearied to death of Andrew, and thats the very truth it is.</USER><BOT>O Millie - I wonder how twould feel to be you for half-an-hour and to have such a fine suitor coming to me and asking for me to say Yes.</BOT>
<USER>Youll be able to fancy yourself in Bond Street when you see it, Miss Clara.</USER><BOT>Now, you do excite me, Mister Hooper.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis in her place as th old woman will be set come morning - And that herll be - I count as tis long enough as her have mistressed it over the house.    You old she fox, you may gather the pads of you in under of you now, and crouch you down tother side of the fire like any other old woman of your years - for my Mays comed back, and herll show you your place what youve not known where twas in all the days of your old wicked life.  So tis.</USER><BOT>Her hant changed a hair of her, th old stoat!  Soon as I heard the note of she, the heat bubbled up in I, though twas chattering in the cold as I had been but a moment afore.  One of they dirty roadsters - Ill learn you to come disturbing of a wedding party, I will.    No, you baint changed, you hardened old sinner - but the words out of the cruel old mouth of you dont hurt I any more - not they.  I be passed out of the power of such as you.  I knowed Id have to face you when I comed back, but I knowed, too, as I should brush you out of the way of me, like I would brush one of they old maid flies.</BOT>
<USER>A jay bird in peacocks feathers, thats what tis.  And shes took you all in, the every one of you.</USER><BOT>O George, isnt she really our aunt from London?</BOT>
<USER>O what a wise thought, Master Jerry.</USER><BOT>Most suitable, I call it.</BOT>
<USER>That I shall, then - come you here, Dorry - Ill whisper it to your ear.  [Whispers it to DORRY.</USER><BOT>I know who tis - I know - tis for Mr. Davis - for Mr. Davis!  Think of that, Dad - the flower tis for George Davis.</BOT>
<USER>Ill do it, Gran.  Ill do it for your sake.  Tis very likely true what you do say, all of you.  Id but dance my feet off for naught.  When he came to look into my gipsy eyes, twould all be over and done with.</USER><BOT>the control does not work</BOT>
<USER>Nay - strangers from London town would have no liking for the songs we sing down here among the fields.</USER><BOT>There was a song I once heard in the country that pleased me very well.</BOT>
<USER>There tis - theres where th old gander have left his mark.</USER><BOT>Where, where!  O do let us see!</BOT>
<USER>Ill be hanged if Ill stand any more of this caddling nonsense.  Here, Mill - the traps come to the door.  Into it with you, I say.</USER><BOT>I beg you to wait a moment, master.</BOT>
<USER>Annie, Im fair beside myself this day.</USER><BOT>O, Steve, there was never a day in my life like this one.  [DORRY and JANE come down.</BOT>
<USER>O William, you have made me very happy - I do feel all mazy like with my gladness.</USER><BOT>Well, Julia, we might do worse than to - to - name the day.</BOT>
<USER>Annet, Millie will have none of my blossoms.  I should like it well if you would carry them in your hand to church this day.</USER><BOT>Me, Andrew?</BOT>
<USER>Id have been content to bide with the door shut - so long as it was shut with they two and me inside the room - th old woman - well, I count I shouldnt have took many thought for she - she could have bided in her place if shed had a mind - Id have set me down, when once my clothes was decent and clean, and put my hands to the work and made a tidy wife for Steve, as good nor better than that there dressed-up thing out yonder - And bred Dorry up the right way, too, I would.  But tis done with now, so tis.</USER><BOT>what are you talking about</BOT>
<USER>Youll never go and change towards me now that were most as good as wed, will you, Mister Hooper?</USER><BOT>Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour to wish you all a very pleasant evening.</BOT>
<USER>O mistress, what sort of an appearance has the gentleman?</USER><BOT>I dont know how to answer you, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Im sure Im quite agreeable, Luke.  Twill help to pass away the morning.</USER><BOT>- Scene 2.</BOT>
<USER>Annet did pass me as I came through the yard, Master</USER><BOT>So thats where youve been, you deceitful little wench.</BOT>
<USER>I likes the looks of it better nor this great old house.</USER><BOT>Now I daresay theres but one thing wanted over there, Mister Jeremy.</BOT>
<USER>To church, Missis?</USER><BOT>Theres marrying being done down here to-day.</BOT>
<USER>I warrant there be no lack of words to the inside of you, if so be as youd open you mouth a bit wider.  Tis not silence as a maid is troubled with in general.</USER><BOT>O, I have plenty of words ready, John, should you care to hear them.</BOT>
<USER>I wouldnt have had it happen so for the world, Mr. Jenner.</USER><BOT>Twas none of your doing, Miss Clara.  Youve naught to blame yourself for.  Tis not your fault as youre made so - so beautiful, and yet so homely.</BOT>
<USER>She had a wonderful soft look in her eyes as she did handle them and the spring cabbage, John.</USER><BOT>Ah, and a wonderful hard tongue when her knowed twasnt for she as they was pulled.</BOT>
<USER>And from the time when th old gander did take a big piece right out of her arm, Georgie?</USER><BOT>I count her be wonderful changed, like.</BOT>
<USER>I never knowed my mammy.  Granma says she had got summat bad in her blood.  And Grannys got the same.  But Miss Sims, shes ever so nice to Dad and me, and Im real pleased as shes coming to stop along of us always after that theyre married, like.</USER><BOT>And th old woman whats your granma, Dorry?</BOT>
<USER>That I will.  We will find out what is to be upon the table, and then I will shew you how it is to be eaten.</USER><BOT>And other things as well as eating.  When I be sitting in the parlour, Miss Clara, and Hooper, he comes up and asks my pleasure, what have I got to say to him?</BOT>
<USER>And whens a man to look pleased if tis not on his wedding morn, Dorry?</USER><BOT>The tramp what was here did say as how twas poor work twice marrying, but you dont find it be so, Dad, do you now?</BOT>
<USER>Whilst my lady belongs to his lordships own class, tis but suitable as she should be the one to wed with him - knowing the foreign tongues and all, and playing so sweetly on her instruments.  Theres a lady anyone would be proud to take before the Court in London.</USER><BOT>I could do with a little pig up at our place if Id the silver to take into the market for to buy him with.  [A silence.</BOT>
<USER>And th old clocks another thing what Dad did say as youd look upon.</USER><BOT>O the old clocks well enough, to be sure.</BOT>
<USER>A water plant do grow best by the stream, and a blossom, from the meadows, midst the grass.  Let each sort bide in the place where twas seeded.</USER><BOT>No, no, George, you dont know what youre talking about.  A little country wench may bloom into something very modish and elegant, once taken from her humble home and set amongst carpets of velvet and curtains of satin.  Youll see.</BOT>
<USER>Whats this, Rose?  I hant heard tell of this afore.  Be there aught a-going on with you and George, then?</USER><BOT>No, Steve, there isnt nothing in it much, except that George and me we walked out last Sunday in the evening like - and a two or three time before.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Mr. Davis, who would ever have thought it?</USER><BOT>Your health, Steve, and yours, too, Miss Sims.  And many years of happiness to you both.</BOT>
<USER>Well, and where have you been all this while, Id like to know?</USER><BOT>To Brook Farm, mam, and home.</BOT>
<USER>O let me go along of her too -</USER><BOT>If ever there was a careless little wench, tis she.  I never did hold with the bringing up of other folks children and if Id had my way, tis to the poor-house theyd have went, instead of coming here where Ive enough to do with my own.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Susan, get you to your place in the kitchen, as quick as you can.  John, put yon roadsters through the gate, if you please.    Now young Miss?</USER><BOT>A very good evening to you, mistress.  And let me make Chris known to you for he and I are to be wed to-morrow.</BOT>
<USER>Your brother Giles was never very grand with the pen, Annet.  But, O, hes none the worse for that.</USER><BOT>Millie, I never cared for to question you, but how was it when you and he did part, one with tother?</BOT>
<USER>O that I would, master.</USER><BOT>Should you care to see - to see where the young celery is planted out?</BOT>
<USER>Granny do say a lot of funny things sometimes, dont she, now?</USER><BOT>You get and put on your hat and button your gloves, and let the old gipsy be.  We can send her off home when tis afternoon, and us back from church.  Now, where did I lay that bonnet?  Here tis.</BOT>
<USER>Ten or fifteen shillings the yard, and not a penny under, Ill be bound.</USER><BOT>O do come and talk to me again and leave off messing with the old silk.</BOT>
<USER>All the orange blossom in the world baint so sweet as one kiss from your lips, Rose.</USER><BOT>Now is that truly so?</BOT>
<USER>Much the same as tis with that bird flying yonder.  I did so as I listed.  If I had a mind to sleep when the sun was up, then I did sleep.  And if my limbs would not rest when twas dark, why, then I did roam.  There was naught to hold me back from my fancy.</USER><BOT>And how is it now with you, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>O Mister - Mister Jenner, I feel so faint.</USER><BOT>begins to fan her.]  I assure you she means nothing by it.  Its her way.  You see, she knows no better.</BOT>
<USER>Tis clear you know little of the ways of our town beauties, Luke.</USER><BOT>Still, I mean to have my try with her, Miles Hooper.</BOT>
<USER>Ive heard them tell of that, I have.</USER><BOT>And of the good leaves there is hounds tongue.  Wear it at the feet of you against dogs what be savage.  Herb Benet you nail upon the door.  No witch nor evil thing can enter to your house.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  You come along with me this moment, William.  Tis a too many words by far that youve had with John already, and much good theyve done to you.  Come you in with me.</USER><BOT>O Im blessed if I do know whether tis on my head or on my feet that Im standing.</BOT>
<USER>I see naught of any house afore us or behind.  Tis very likely dusk as is upon us, or may happen tis the fog getting up from the river.</USER><BOT>Look you across that stile, Harry.  There be a field path, baint there?</BOT>
<USER>Look up quickly, mistress.  Theres Hooper.</USER><BOT>Then Ill run away.  May all be well with you, dear Joan.  [CLARA goes out.</BOT>
<USER>Is this really so, my maid?</USER><BOT>Who ever would have thought on such a thing?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, that must be a grand sound, the barking of a fox.  I never did hear one.  Never.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis a powerful thin sound, that - but one to raise the hair on a mans head and to clam the flesh of he, at dead of night.</BOT>
<USER>I daresay youll be told all in good season.  Here, take up and get on with that sewing, I dislike to see young people idling away their time.</USER><BOT>And now, untie the packets quickly, uncle.</BOT>
<USER>Giles be safe enough in them foreign parts where I did send him.  Youve no need to trouble your head about he, Mother - unless tis a letter as he may have got sending to Mill.</USER><BOT>No, Father, Giles has never sent a letter since the day he left home.  But very often there is no need for letters to keep remembrance green.  Tis a plant what thrives best on a soil that is bare.</BOT>
<USER>O, Mister Jenner, now did you really?</USER><BOT>But when I met you in the wood - saw you sitting there, so still and yet so bright, so fine and yet so homely.  Thats the maid for me, I says to myself.</BOT>
<USER>No one would trouble to set a snare for me, master.  I baint worth trapping.</USER><BOT>You be a brave, fine country lad, George, what a pretty baggage from London town might give a year of her life to catch, so be it her had the fortune.</BOT>
<USER>There be darkness lying atween you and me, May.</USER><BOT>Then come you close to I, Harry, and look well into they.</BOT>
<USER>And at tother end of it a house whats got a garden fence all round.</USER><BOT>Ah - and tis so.  And now as I comes to look there be a light shining from out the windows of it, too, though tis shining dim-like in the mist.</BOT>
<USER>Well - tis for George as Ive saved it out of some what the gardener up at Squires gived me.</USER><BOT>Tis a powerful many years since George he went a-courting.  I never knowed him so much as look upon a maid, I didnt since -</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, you keep her out of mischief</USER><BOT>Ive got my own dress to put on.</BOT>
<USER>Give me your hand, Annet.</USER><BOT>Millie - dont you want to give a drink of water to yon poor old man?</BOT>
<USER>A twelve year gone by, my child.</USER><BOT>Ill give it you if you starts off again.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a fine thing to have a home what you can get in and go to, May, with a bit of fire to heat the limbs of you at, and plenty of victuals as you can put inside.  How was it as you ever came away from it, like?</USER><BOT>Ah, and thats what I be asking of myself most of the time, Harry!  For, tis summat like a twelve or eleven year since I shut the door behind me and went out.</BOT>
<USER>Tisnt likely as his lordship would set his thoughts on a wench what could caper about like a Morris man upon the high road.  So there.</USER><BOT>I never danced upon the high road, I dances only where tis dark with gloom and no eyes upon me.  No mortal eyes.</BOT>
<USER>Us did but come up for to - to give a handshake to sister Clara, like.</USER><BOT>Well, now you can go off back to work again.  And you -  - now that youve finished curling of your hair and dressing of yourself up, you can go and sit down in the best parlour along with your fancy gentlemen.</BOT>
<USER>I dont know how I should stand up against the worry of it all, wasnt it for you, Mary.</USER><BOT>Twill be a bit lonesome for me here, when theyve gone off, Mary.</BOT>
<USER>Miles Hooper would like Missy to ask for all that is his.</USER><BOT>O, Mister Hooper, how kind you are.</BOT>
<USER>And I would like to know how twas as Steve saw I.</USER><BOT>i dont know anything about steve. who is that?</BOT>
<USER>Ill wash it, Aunt.  Come May, you see aunt doesnt want us any longer.</USER><BOT>Now theyre going to talk secrets together.  O I should dearly love to hear the secrets of grown-up people.  [ANNET and MAY go out together.</BOT>
<USER>No - do you bide a moment here with me.</USER><BOT>What are we going to do?</BOT>
<USER>Come, think what twill feel to be along of our dear loves and look upon the forms of them and hear the notes of their voices once again.</USER><BOT>Thats what I am a-thinking of.  Twill be hot iron drove right into the heart all the while.  Ah, thats about it.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and you might ring.</USER><BOT>We want someone asll fasten them niggly hooks to our gowns.</BOT>
<USER>But I dont favour him.</USER><BOT>Youll favour him powerful well when you see him, Julia.</BOT>
<USER>No one could work with them laces a-falling down all over their fingers.</USER><BOT>You should turn back your sleeves for kitchen work, Joan, same as Maggie does.</BOT>
<USER>I know who tis, too, cause of the spangled plumes in the bonnet of she.  Mother said as thered be some.</USER><BOT>Well, Clara, if twas by the morning coach as you did come, youre late.  If twas by th evening one, youre too soon by a good few hours.</BOT>
<USER>Go on, Joan, dont be afraid.</USER><BOT>It did seem to fall in with the game I was a-playing with myself.  And then, before I did know how, twas they was both of them a-taking me for you, mam.</BOT>
<USER>There, there, you be one as is too handy with the tongue, like.  Dont you go for to waste the breath inside of you when youll be wanting all your words for they as bides up yonder and as doesnt know that you be coming back.</USER><BOT>Harry, you take the tin and fill it at the ditch and give I to drink.  Tis all live coals within I here, so tis.</BOT>
<USER>Ah and so I did, but when I comed to think it over, Fairs baint the place for little maids, I says to mother here - and no, that they baint, she answers back.  But well see how tis when you be growed a bit older, like.  Usll see how twill be then, wont us Mother?</USER><BOT>I wouldnt encourage the child in her nonsense, if I was you, Dan.  Shes old enough to know better than to ask to be taken to such places.  Why in all my days I never set my foot within a fair, pleasure or business, nor wanted to, either.</BOT>
<USER>Do not keep me in suspense, Miss Clara.</USER><BOT>What about, sir?</BOT>
<USER>Tis the lies of they be growed big as wheat stalks and the hardness of their hearts be worse nor death.  But tis to judgment as they shall be led, now you be comed home, May, and the hand of God shall catch they when they do crawl like adders upon the earth.  Ah, and do you mind how twas you served old Vashti, what never did harm to no one all the life of her, I shall call out to th old woman in that hour when her shall be burning in the lake.  And her shall beg for a drop of water to lay upon the withered tongue of she, and it shall be denied, for other hands nor ours be at work, and tis the wicked as shall perish - yes, so tis.</USER><BOT>Stop that, Mother, I wants to get at my thoughts.</BOT>
<USER>O do tell us of all that you did see there, Uncle.</USER><BOT>There was a cow - well, tis a smartish lot of cows as Ive seen in my time, but this one, why, the King havent got the match to she in all his great palace, and thats the truth, so tis.</BOT>
<USER>Thatll be Mister Hooper, I should think.</USER><BOT>I should go riding in my own chaise, mistress, if twas him.</BOT>
<USER>You will.  Youll do it for the sake of poor old Gran, whats been father and mother to you - and whats gone hungered and thirsty so that you might have bread and drink.</USER><BOT>O I can never give him up.</BOT>
<USER>Who?</USER><BOT>Well - the new farm hand.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, youve got to go and dress her for the church.  But you can spare me a minute or two first.</USER><BOT>Indeed, that is what I cannot do, master.  Tis late already.</BOT>
<USER>Dont you ever go for to get married, master.  There could never come a worser caddle into a mans days nor matrimony, I count.</USER><BOT>Was Mary Meadows asked to drop in at any time to-day, Rose?</BOT>
<USER>So it do seem.  For to-day tis all thorns and thistles with you - But Im a-goin to have my look at your pretty face and my kiss of it too.</USER><BOT>I shall scream out loud if you touches me - that I shall.</BOT>
<USER>Dont you hear what I be saying, Mill?  Come you down at once.  [There is no answer.</USER><BOT>Millie, there be Andrew a-waiting for to take you to church.  Come you down this minute.</BOT>
<USER>O, I didnt know you was here, Mistress Julia.</USER><BOT>Well, Susan, and so you live at Road Farm.  Are you happy there?</BOT>
<USER>Why, of course it be, Granny.  Dont you see how tis cleaned and the new net curtains in the windows, and the bit of drugget gainst the door where the old one always tripped me up?</USER><BOT>I see naught but what tis more like a burial here.  So tis.  And tis a burial as Ive carried in my heart as I comed down from the hills.</BOT>
<USER>O, let me be, all of you!  I declare, I dont know which way to look, I dont.</USER><BOT>Ill show you, Annie, then.</BOT>
<USER>I reckon twould take a rare lot of doing to change that, mistress.</USER><BOT>Baint you a-goin to get yourself ready for church soon?</BOT>
<USER>O leave me alone - you be worse nor a nest of waspes - that you be.</USER><BOT>Usll smoke them out of their holes one day - see if us do not.</BOT>
<USER>Well, George, tisnt much worse nor I expected.</USER><BOT>I dont like Aunt Clara.</BOT>
<USER>ing her eyes with the back of her hands.]  Tears be for them as have idle times and not for poor wenches what mind cattle and goats.  Come, play me my own music, Jock.  And play it as I do like it best.</USER><BOT>A wondrous bold dance, upon my word - could it have been that which captivated my lord, Alice?</BOT>
<USER>Impossible, my good sir!</USER><BOT>Ah, thats it.  Miles Hooper, hes the happy man.  If you be come by Painswick High Street youll have seen his name up over the shop door.</BOT>
<USER>Maggies fond of Georgie.  And Georgies kind to Mag.</USER><BOT>O dont, Miss Jessie, for goodness sake.</BOT>
<USER>There be a piece of blue ribbon, George.</USER><BOT>They be coming down and into the room now, master.  [Steps are heard in the staircase.</BOT>
<USER>How strange this country tongue must fall on your ears, Miss Clara!</USER><BOT>I dont understand about half of what they say.</BOT>
<USER>So bruised and wounded in the heart that the road from Framilode up here might well have been a hundred miles or more.</USER><BOT>Framilode?  Tis there you come from?</BOT>
<USER>Indeed, I shall be glad to rest on a comfortable couch.  Im dead tired of the country air already.</USER><BOT>Youll not go off to sleep afore the chicken and sparrow grass is ate, will you, Aunt?</BOT>
<USER>O that would please me more than anything in the world.</USER><BOT>And when twas got a little lighter, so that the bushes could be seen, and the fields, Id shew you where the partridge has her nest beneath the hedge; where we have gotten eggs, and eaten them too.</BOT>
<USER>O Andrew, Ill mend your heart one day.</USER><BOT>Millie, the sound of those words has mended it already.</BOT>
<USER>Dont you go for to listen to her, Dorry, nor Steve, neither.  Shes that flustered herself about the dance to-night that she scarce do know what shes a-saying of.  But suppose you was just to ask her what shes got wrapped so careful in that there paper in her hand.</USER><BOT>O, Rosie, whatever is it?</BOT>
<USER>Me, John?  Why, Ive never clapped eyes on Master William Gardner so far as I know of.</USER><BOT>But heve clapped eyes on you, mistress - twas at Church last Sunday.  And tis not a bit of food, nor a drop of drink, nor an hour of sleep, as Master William have taken since.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and tis a rare good little wench, Annet - though she baint so showy as ourn.  A rare good little maid.  And now tis time we was all off to church, seeing as this is to be a case of double harness like.</USER><BOT>O Annet, you cant be wed in that plain gown.</BOT>
<USER>And about time, too.  Tis to be hoped as we shant have no more trouble with her till morning.</USER><BOT>Just look, why the latch is up.</BOT>
<USER>I dont know so well about that.</USER><BOT>Go on, Rosie - pin it into his coat.  Come, tis getting late.</BOT>
<USER>O that she has, George.</USER><BOT>She didnt seem to know him by her looks.</BOT>
<USER>Tis masters hand in marriage, and a couple of pigs jowls, home-cured, within this here basket.</USER><BOT>O my good man, youre making game of me.</BOT>
<USER>Go off and dance to your own animals, Miss Goatherd.  All of us be a-going to practise our steps against May Day.  Come along girls.</USER><BOT>They mock me in the name they have fixed to me - Princess Royal.</BOT>
<USER>Whos that come bothering round!  Run and see, Dorry, theres a good child.</USER><BOT>Itll be Granma Vashti, I daresay.  She do mostly knock at the door loud with her stick.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, Grannie, sit you down along of we.</USER><BOT>And in the night when I was laid down, against the windowpane it fled a three times.  A three time it fled and did beat the pane as though twould get in.  And I up and did open the window.  And the air it ran past I, and twas black, with naught upon it but the smell of a shroud.  So I knowed.</BOT>
<USER>Im not one that can be taken by surprise, Dan.  May, lay that parcel on the table at once, and put away your uncles hat and overcoat.</USER><BOT>Nay, the overcoats too heavy for the little maid - Ill hang it up myself.</BOT>
<USER>I wants to be let to go to the dancing, Dad - now that Ive got my frock on and all. - O, I wants to be let to go.</USER><BOT>Well, Mother - what do you say?  Twouldnt hurt for she to look in about half an hour, and Annie and me we could bring her back betimes.</BOT>
<USER>I dont hold with drinking nor with taking bites atween meals, but as your uncle has come a good distance, and the day is warm, you make take the key of the pantry, Annet, and draw a glass of cider for him.</USER><BOT>Thats it, Mother - thats it.  And when Ive wetted my mouth a bit Ill be able the better to tell you all about how twas over there.</BOT>
<USER>A fine young lady like you can do as she pleases.</USER><BOT>Well then, it pleases me to bide with you in the free air.</BOT>
<USER>That Ill be bound you have not, Master William, though a finer gentleman than yourself is not to be found in all the country side.</USER><BOT>Is that how I appear to you, John?</BOT>
<USER>And me and Nat are to be married too, mistress.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  I should have given you notice anyhow to-night, Susan, so perhaps its just as well you have made sure of some sort of a roof to your head.</BOT>
<USER>Katie Sims be younger nor me and shes let to go, she is.</USER><BOT>ah i see</BOT>
<USER>Or that folks do come as thick as flies on a summers day from all parts of the country for to buy the wheat what he do grow.  Ah, and before tis cut or like to be, they be a fighting for it, all of them, like a pack of dogs with a bone.  So tis.</USER><BOT>Twasnt that, I dont think.</BOT>
<USER>All right!  And is that about all as youve seen?  Why, bless you, Steve, where have you gone and hid your tongue I should like to know!</USER><BOT>Well, there baint nothing wrong, be there?</BOT>
<USER>Put her out and shut the door, George, and thatll learn the likes of she to come round begging at folks houses whats respectable.</USER><BOT>Tis poor work shutting the door on such as her this night.</BOT>
<USER>Youve got to bide somewhere nigh me, John.  I could not be left alone with a wench whos a stranger to me.</USER><BOT>Dont you get flustered, Master William.  See here, Ill hide me ahind of yon bushes, and if so be as you should want me, why, there Im close at hand.</BOT>
<USER>And I could set she back in her place, too, that tricked-up, flashy thing over the way.  Ive but to climb the stairs and clap my hand on Steve - Get you from your dreams, I have got but to say, the woman whats yourn be comed home.  Her have tasted the cup of death, very near, and her have been a-thirst and an hungered.  But her has carried summat for you in her heart all the way what you wouldnt find in the heart of tother, no, not if you was to cut it open and search it through.  And the right belongs to I to shut the door on tother hussey, holding Steve to I till death divides we.</USER><BOT>Going on the road I seed the eyes of they blinking as I did pass by.  And may the light from out the thunder cloud fall upon you, I says to them, for tis a poor old woman as I be what has lost her child; and whats that to you if so be as the shoes on her feet be broken or no?  Tis naked as the toes of you shall go, that hour when the days of this world shall be rolled by.  Ah, tis naked and set on the lake of burning fire as the hoofs of you shall run!</BOT>
<USER>Well, the both of you shall rest this night beneath the grandest roof that ever sheltered a mans head.  And you shall sit at a table spread as youve not seen this many a year.</USER><BOT>Thatll be sommat to think on, master, when us gets upon our legs again.</BOT>
<USER>Soft and sweet as the field lark, George.</USER><BOT>Then that had been the one for you to have wed, Master Thomas.</BOT>
<USER>Thats it, master.  Tis a rare weight as Ive been carrying across my back since dawn.</USER><BOT>Ah, I be pleased for to lay aside yon.  Tis wonderful heavy work, this journeying to and fro with gold and silver.</BOT>
<USER>And then, Joan?</USER><BOT>And then, when was all fixed up comfortable between us, mistress, maybe as you could break it gently to him so as he wouldnt think no worse of me.</BOT>
<USER>That I shall, dear Nat.</USER><BOT>Well, Master John, have you a fancy to come tenting along of we.</BOT>
<USER>i simply wanna plain talk to you</USER><BOT>what is your favourite hobby</BOT>
<USER>Well, bless my soul, but women folk have got some powerful strange tricks to them.</USER><BOT>There - my gift to you, master.</BOT>
<USER>Too late!  There tis, I be comed home too late.</USER><BOT>well, no it came</BOT>
<USER>Very well, mistress.  If I set off in a few moments it will do, I suppose?  I should just like to take a peep at myself as I am now, in the little glass which you carry in your silk bag.</USER><BOT>Dont spend too much time looking at what will be shewn you, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Well, tis as the frost might lie on a dead leaf now, May, that it be.</USER><BOT>And the colour on me was as a rose, and my limbs was straight.  Twas fleet like a rabbit as I could get about, the days that was then, Harry.</BOT>
<USER>i just wanna talk with you</USER><BOT>i simply wanna plain talk to you</BOT>
<USER>And that Id never do, though Im blest if I know why you did it.</USER><BOT>It was as much my fault as hers, Mister Jenner.  There were things that each of us wanted, and that we thought we might get, by changing places, one with the other.</BOT>
<USER>Well - and whats the next pleasure, Madam?</USER><BOT>Whats Missys next pleasure?</BOT>
<USER>Miss Clara did never send but two letters home in all the while she was gone.  The first of them did tell as how th old lady was dead and had left all of her fortune to Miss Clara.  And the second was to say as how her was coming back to the farm this morning.</USER><BOT>And hark you here, George, was naught mentioned about Miss Claras fine suitors in neither of them letters?</BOT>
<USER>Then so will I.  Well go.</USER><BOT>Whatever shall we do, John!  Me not dressed, everything no how, and them expected in less nor a half hours time</BOT>
<USER>I would hold out my two arms wide to her, and catch she.</USER><BOT>And did she never fall, whilst springing from the tree, George?</BOT>
<USER>In April, in May, and in June likewise</USER><BOT>When small birds they do sing.</BOT>
<USER>Im off.  Ive no patience to listen any longer.  You called me roadster varmint.  Well, let it be so.  On the road I was born and on the road I was picked from my dead mothers side, and I count as tis on the road as I shall breathe my last.  But for all that, Ill not have road dirt flung on me by no one.  For, roadsters varmint though I be, there be things which I do hold brighter nor silver and cleaner nor new opened leaves, and Ill not have defilement throwed upon them.</USER><BOT>The lads raving.  Tis plain as hes been getting at the cider.  Come you off with me to the haymaking, Robin and Jess.</BOT>
<USER>Mistress be at the gooseberries a-gathering of them, and the children be gone off to th hay field.</USER><BOT>Tis very likely your serving maid, dear Miss.  Shall I fetch the young woman in to you?</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  And you have come to a ripe age when tis the plain duty of a man to turn himself towards matrimony, William.</USER><BOT>Tis a bit of quiet that Im after, Mother.</BOT>
<USER>Rose-Anna she was called, of Daniels mill up yonder.</USER><BOT>Rose-Anna - She with whom I was to have gone to church.</BOT>
<USER>Do you think our aunt Clara has growed into a coxsy town lady, George?</USER><BOT>No, I do not, Miss Jessie.</BOT>
<USER>Youre right there, mistress.  But the clock have moved powerful slow all these last few weeks - for look you here, tis a month this day since I last set eyes on Mill or had a word from her lips - so tis.</USER><BOT>Youll have enough words presently.  Hark, shes coming down with Father now.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Nonsense, when was one of our family ever known to fail in the tongue?</USER><BOT>If she that was asked first had only been the right one, all would have been over and done with now.</BOT>
<USER>And what is the man called, John?</USER><BOT>I am called William.</BOT>
<USER>There wont be nothing to fear then, mistress.</USER><BOT>Make him love you for yourself, Joan.  O we must each tie the heart of our true love so tightly to our own that naught shall ever be able to cut the bonds.</BOT>
<USER>That I never shall.  Now call to Laura.  Is she in the lane outside?</USER><BOT>There, she be come to the gate now.</BOT>
<USER>Let I be.  You do torment anyone till they scarce do know if they has senses to them or no.</USER><BOT>Youre not one to miss what you never had, Nat.</BOT>
<USER>I reckon as her missed her footing, like.</USER><BOT>Well, upon my word, George, whod have thought on such a thing!</BOT>
<USER>Has Aunt Clara got her mouth very sticky, then?</USER><BOT>And there be others what are born to naught but crusts and the vinegar.</BOT>
<USER>That shews how little you do know.  Twill be better nor ever with me then.</USER><BOT>Twill be alone by yourself as youll go walking, Su.</BOT>
<USER>Ive caught him at the cask soon after dawn.</USER><BOT>And so have I, John.  How you put up with his independent ways I dont know.</BOT>
<USER>If Ive been and forgot you two old women, Ive remembered myself.  Be blowed if I can get through any more of this foolishness without a wet of my mouth.</USER><BOT>Does it show upon my face, the crying, Robert?</BOT>
<USER>Leave your sorrowful tears till later, my friends.  This fresh water from the spring will revive you from your travelling.</USER><BOT>The heart of me is stricken past all remedy, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Now, Lucy, we must look sharp; Mister Robert and his cousins from Bristol town will soon be here.  I have not met with the cousins yet, but Ive been told as theyre very fine ladies - They stood in place of parents to my Robert, you know.  Tis unfortunate we should be in such a sad muddle the day they come.</USER><BOT>When I have helped you into your gown, mistress, I shall soon have the dinner spread and all in order.  I be used to such work, and Im considered spry upon my feet.</BOT>
<USER>Wont you take the bouquet along of you?</USER><BOT>No - let it bide there.  I can have it later.</BOT>
<USER>Summat lost - summat lost, and what was trying to get safe away.</USER><BOT>Safe away?  From what, Granny?</BOT>
<USER>For twas wild as I was in the time gone by.  Wild after pleasuring and the noise in the town, and men a-looking at the countenance of I, and a-turning back for to look again.  But, hark you here, tis powerful changed as I be now.</USER><BOT>Ah, I count as you be.  Be changed from a young woman into an old one.</BOT>
<USER>Here, loosen my cloak, Joan, and untie the ribbons of my bonnet.</USER><BOT>O mistress, keep the pretty clothes upon you till you have got to the house.</BOT>
<USER>Then hell have to take it now, John.  And Im thinking tis time you set off home again with your load.</USER><BOT>Well, mistress, I dont particular care to go afore you have given me a good word or sommat asll hearten up poor Master William in his love sickness.</BOT>
<USER>I would not spoil this moment, but by and bye my sweet Missy shall tell me all the particulars of her income, and such trifles.</USER><BOT>O let us not destroy to-day by thoughts of anything but our dear affection one for tother.</BOT>
<USER>And yourn?</USER><BOT>I dont rightly recollect.</BOT>
<USER>Tis that wench Susan, since you ask me, master.  But not a word of it to th old mistress.</USER><BOT>Ill not mention it, John.</BOT>
<USER>Theres the man William.</USER><BOT>I baint a-goin to leave the place to a stranger.</BOT>
<USER>And wedding veil and all.  And sister and me hooked up into our new sprigs, ready for the ceremony.</USER><BOT>Let them bide.  The mushll swim out of they same as twill swim off the cider vat.  Just let the young fools bide.</BOT>
<USER>Indeed?  And who may your master be, John?</USER><BOT>Tis Master William Gardner, whats the talk of the country for miles around, mistress.  And that he be.</BOT>
<USER>I wouldnt take on so, if twas me.</USER><BOT>And did you say as how there was a light in the window?  Twill be but fire light then, for th old woman she never would bring out the lamp afore twas night, close-handed old she-cat as her was, whatd lick up a drop of oil on to the tongue of her sooner nor it should go wasted.</BOT>
<USER>Youve given your heart?</USER><BOT>Yes, Chris has all of it, Laura.  There is nothing left for anyone else in the world.</BOT>
<USER>Briars, Joan.  Thorns of pride, and many another sharp and hurting thing.</USER><BOT>Then take you my counsel, mistress, and have his lordship when he do offer next.</BOT>
<USER>But youll have to stir yourself up and deck the house and set the table and wait upon the visitors and look to the traps and horses and all, Jerry - seeing as youre the only one.</USER><BOT>Ill not.  Im not one as steps beyond my own work, and master do know it too.</BOT>
<USER>O Father, you are good to me.</USER><BOT>And a silk cloak as well.</BOT>
<USER>George -</USER><BOT>Who named George?  There was but one man as was called by that name - and he courted my girl till her was faint and weary of the sound and shape of he, and so on a day when he was come -</BOT>
<USER>I gathered them up in the morning so soon.</USER><BOT>While the sweet birds so sweetly sing,</BOT>
<USER>I have help for all torments in my flowers.  Such things be given us for that.</USER><BOT>You be gentle in your voices mistress.  Tis like when a quist do sing, as you speaks.</BOT>
<USER>door which GEORGE shuts behind them.]</USER><BOT>Well, now - but thats a smartish wench, getting him out so quiet, like.  George, youd best step after them to see as the young man dont annoy her in any way.</BOT>
<USER>Whats wrong now, mistress?</USER><BOT>Taint chicken at all what youve been and fetched me.</BOT>
<USER>Well sit down, now.  John wont be a moment before hes here.</USER><BOT>Thats right.  Everyone in their places?  But no cover laid for Mary?</BOT>
<USER>Totherll be broughted lower.</USER><BOT>Look you here, old Missis, tis a stomach full of naught as I carries.  If so be as you has a crust to spare -</BOT>
<USER>Not if I know it.  Stop where you are, Jess.  Robin, you dare to move.  If Clara wants to eat and drink Im afeared she must wait till supper time.</USER><BOT>There be chicken and sparrow grass for supper, Aunt.</BOT>
<USER>Millies not a-dressing of herself up.  I heard her crying pitiful as I was gathering flowers in the garden.</USER><BOT>Crying?  Shell have something to cry about if she doesnt look out, when her father comes in, and hears how shes a-going on.</BOT>
<USER>Your hairs well enough like that.  Tisnt of hair as anyonell be thinking when they comes in, but of victuals.  And how were a-going to get the table and all fixed up in so short a time do fairly puzzle me.</USER><BOT>Ill do the table.</BOT>
<USER>We does our work with our own hands.  Wed be ashamed if twas otherwise.</USER><BOT>Ive been and engaged a house-full of servants for Rose-Anna.  She shall know what tis to live like a lady once she enters our family.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, this courting business, tis a rare caddling muddle when tis all done and said.</USER><BOT>Tis according as some folks do find it, Master John.</BOT>
<USER>Say what you like, John.  Only let me bide quiet in this good forest now.  I want to be with my thoughts.</USER><BOT>Hers a wonderful contrary bird to be sure.  And baint a shy one neither, what gets timid and flustered and is easily netted.  My word, but me and master has a job before us for to catch she.</BOT>
<USER>John, my man, heres a five pound note to your pocket.  Id never have won this lady here if it hadnt been for you.</USER><BOT>Dont name it, dear master.  Tis a long courtship what has no ending to it, so I always says.</BOT>
<USER>O do not let us waste any more time!  Jerry, do you take the man and shew him his work in the back kitchen; and Lucy, come to me and help me with my gown and my hair dressing.  We have not a minute to lose.</USER><BOT>They may be upon us any time now.  Ill go out and gather the flowers for the parlour, since you dont want me any more within, Rose.</BOT>
<USER>If Ive told you once, Ive told you twenty times, twas but the one pair of hands as I was gived at birth.  Now, what have you got to say against that, Thomas?</USER><BOT>Im sure I dont know.</BOT>
<USER>Anything to please you, Mother -</USER><BOT>I hear her coming, Uncle.  I hear the noise of the silk.</BOT>
<USER>Steve!  Whats it to Steve whether the like of I do go or bide?  What be there in I for to quell the love of she which Steves got in him?  Dead leaves for new.  Ditch water for the clear spring.</USER><BOT>Give him to drink of it, May.</BOT>
<USER>Then youve no call to wish as her whos gone should come back to you, like?</USER><BOT>Whats that youre saying?</BOT>
<USER>Shes a-taking of it off, Aunt, she is.</USER><BOT>I dont know whats come to the maid.  She dont act like herself to-day.</BOT>
<USER>There - see that blue thing yonder flying from one blossom to another.  Thats how tis with me.  Shut me up close in one place, I perish.  Let me go free, and I can fly and live.</USER><BOT>You do talk a powerful lot of foolishness that no one could understand.</BOT>
<USER>Yes, Mrs. Reed, how be you a-keeping now tis come over such nasty weather?</USER><BOT>And how should an old woman be, and her one child out in the rain and all the wind, and driv there too by them as was laid like snakes in the grass about the feet of she, ready for to overthrow she when her should have gotten to a time of weakness.</BOT>
<USER>Hell neer love me again.</USER><BOT>When her love was hid a-hind of the bushes and did hear her a-singing so pitiful, what did he do then?</BOT>
<USER>The income which he thinks I have.</USER><BOT>Ill run, but all this time Ive been keeping Master Luke Jenner quiet in the parlour.</BOT>
<USER>Do you expect me to be carving of the fowls and a-looking out of the window the same time, Thomas?</USER><BOT>George, my lad, do you open the door and see who tis.</BOT>
<USER>And here is Laura to whom I have given all my land and all my money.  She is the mistress of Luthers now.</USER><BOT>Now master, hearken to that.  Cant you lift your spirits a bit.</BOT>
<USER>Get along with you, Susan, and put a cap to your head.  Mistress will be coming out presently, and then you know how twill be if her catches you so.  Get along in with you.</USER><BOT>Now you dont believe what Im telling you - but its true, O its true.</BOT>
<USER>Mine, tis the same tale, very nigh.  Robert the ferry-man and me, we loved and was to have got us wedded, only there came a powerful rich gentleman what used to go fishing along of Robert.  Twas he that ticed my lover off to foreign parts.</USER><BOT>These things are almost more than I can bear.</BOT>
<USER>They call me Princess Royal.</USER><BOT>O that must be in jest.  Why, you are clothed in rags, poor thing.</BOT>
<USER>This is a chance for you, my dear.  Youll not find a better.</USER><BOT>Better?  I count as youll not better thisn.  Good money for your pains - victuals to stuff you proper, and cider, all you can drink on a summers day.  I count youll not better that.</BOT>
<USER>Now Thomas, suppose you was to take that there bread a step further away and eat it in the garden, if eat it you must, instead of crumbling it all over my clean floor.</USER><BOT>Dont you be so testy, Emily.  The dogsll lick the crumbs up as clean as you like presently.</BOT>
<USER>Theres summat whats been clouding you a bit this night.  You didnt know as how Id seen it, but twas so.</USER><BOT>Why, Annie, I didnt think as how youd take notice as I was different from ordinary.</BOT>
<USER>Put in a sprig of thyme, master.</USER><BOT>Yes - I can well spare that.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, Death have been tapping on the door of my body this long while, but, please God, I can hold me with the best of them yet, Harry, and that I can.  Victuals to th inside of I and a bit of clothing to my bones, with summat to quiet this cough as doubles of I up.  Why, there, Harry, you wont know as tis me when Ive been to home a day or two - or may be as twill take a week.</USER><BOT>I count twill take a rare lot of victuals afore you be set up as you once was, May.</BOT>
<USER>But tis yes as you have got to learn, my wench.  And quickly too.  For tis this very evening as Andrew be coming for his answer.  And tis to be yes this time.</USER><BOT>O no, Father.</BOT>
<USER>The lads raving.  Tis plain as hes been getting at the cider.  Come you off with me to the haymaking, Robin and Jess.</USER><BOT>very strange effect</BOT>
<USER>There grows a sharp thorn there.</USER><BOT>Why, Laura, what has made you cry so sadly?</BOT>
<USER>Dorry?  I hant heard tell of she.</USER><BOT>Thats my little baby as was, Harry Moss.  I left she crawling on the floor, and now I count as she be growed into a rare big girl.  Bless the innocent heart of her!</BOT>
<USER>Tis at noon this day that shes to be wed.</USER><BOT>Who are you speaking of, old man?</BOT>
<USER>Thank you, Mr. Davis.</USER><BOT>Hasnt Miss Sims got a nice frock on her for the dance, Mr. Davis?</BOT>
<USER>John, John - Come you here, I say!  Come here.</USER><BOT>My dearest master!</BOT>
<USER>This is the nephew of my dear godmother.  Lord Lovel is his name.</USER><BOT>If you think Im going to be took in with such nonsense, the more fool you, I says.</BOT>
<USER>My good friends, you shall go with me a little further.  And when we have come close upon the farm, you shall stop in the shelter of a wood that I know of and await the signal I shall give you.</USER><BOT>And whatll that be, master?</BOT>
<USER>And what do you want to run about in the garden for when Ive just smoothed your hair and got you all ready to go to church?</USER><BOT>Ive only been helping Annet gather some flowers to put upon the table.</BOT>
<USER>Well, which of the maids would have had the cherry-coloured ribbons to her, Mother?</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Im sure I dont know, but if you go up there courting this afternoon, may happen that youll find out.</BOT>
<USER>Come, Jockie, come ladies - come Gran - well be off to the quiet of our own place where I can learn her ladyship the steps and capers.</USER><BOT>exit</BOT>
<USER>But I wouldnt go with you - No, not for all the gold in the world.</USER><BOT>Ah, youve changed since yesterday.  When I caught your eye at dinner, twas gentle as a doves - and your hand, when it gave me my mug of cider did seem - well did seem to put a caress upon me like.</BOT>
<USER>And what would that be, mistress?</USER><BOT>O Giles, my true love.  You are come just in time.  Another hour and I should have been wed.</BOT>
<USER>Youre about right, Luke.  Now, George, my man, we should very much appreciate a few words with you.</USER><BOT>Morning baint the time for words, masters.  I count as words will keep till the set of sun.  Tis otherwise with work.</BOT>
<USER>No - tis through these faithless ones as us have learnt to understand the hearts within of we.  Lets bide and get the marriage dinner ready for them first.</USER><BOT>It is late afternoon and already dusk.</BOT>
<USER>If Id been given a four arms and legs at birth same as th horses, Id have left a pair of them at home and gone and done the job myself, I would.  And then you should see what Id have brought back.</USER><BOT>You cant better what Ive got here.  From the weight it might be two fat capons.  So it might.</BOT>
<USER>Georgie seemed so big and tall to me in those days.  I wonder how old he really was, when I was seven.</USER><BOT>Would that be a younger brother of yours, like, mistress</BOT>
<USER>And so I told you, Father, from the start.</USER><BOT>And tis No that I shall say.</BOT>
<USER>Then youll please to put your eye somewhere else, Mother, for Ive seen them, and they dont suit me.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Come, this is news, William.  Pray where did you meet?</BOT>
<USER>And that they were.  Why, when I was your age, Annet, I should have been ashamed if I couldnt have held my own in any proper or suitable conversation.</USER><BOT>Ah, you was a rare sensible maid in your day, Mother.  Do you mind when you comed along of me to Kingham sale?  Youre never going to buy an animal with all that white to it, Dan, you says to me.</BOT>
<USER>Tis Moss as I be called, old Missis.  And as I was a-going by this place, I thought as Id look in a moment, just for to ask how twas with May.</USER><BOT>They be all gone out from the house.  All of them.  They be in clothes what do lie in boxes most of the time with lumps of white among they.  Them be set out in the best as they has, and in grand things of many colours.  There tis.</BOT>
<USER>I be busy just now hanging out my cloths, master.</USER><BOT>Leave your dish cloths to dry themselves.  Your mistress wants you, Lucy.</BOT>
<USER>And not more clouded than the heart which is in me, master.  O do you bring me news?</USER><BOT>Is it not all too late for news, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>Let I bide quiet in the dark, tis all I wants now.  [STEVE puts out the lamp.</USER><BOT>Then get off to your drunken sleep again, and your dreams.</BOT>
<USER>Twas - twas the scent out of one of the flowers as got to my eyes, Uncle.</USER><BOT>Well, thats a likely tale it is.  Hear that, Mother?  Tis with her eyes that this little wench do snuff at a flower.  Thats good, baint it?</BOT>
<USER>Tis that mistress be powerful took up with sommat else this afternoon, and so I was able to run out for a while and her didnt notice me.</USER><BOT>Why Su, whats going on up at the farm so particular to-day?</BOT>
<USER>I only know one song, my lord.</USER><BOT>You try now.</BOT>
<USER>Here, Maggie, stir yourself up a bit.  The lady is near fainting, I do count.</USER><BOT>Im bringing the drink for Aunt, Mr. Jenner.  Maggies crying ever so badly, and Mothers sent her upstairs to wash her face and put her hair tidy.</BOT>
<USER>Come here, Georgie, and let Joan hear some of the tales out of what you do sing.</USER><BOT>What would mistress say if she was to catch me at my songs this time of day?</BOT>
<USER>There they be - the both of them.  Turtle doves on the same branch.  Youre right welcome, master, to sit down along of we as one of the family on this occasion.</USER><BOT>I must have come to the wrong place - thats not the Miss Clara Spring I know.</BOT>
<USER>Theres Uncle, back from the Fair.</USER><BOT>O Uncles got some rare big packets in his arms, he has.</BOT>
<USER>A good afternoon to you, sir.</USER><BOT>Upon my word, but you might knock me over.</BOT>
<USER>Master, master, whatever have you got in your head now?</USER><BOT>i just wanna talk with you</BOT>
<USER>See here, master, the lily and the pink.  Them be brave flowers, the both of them, and with a terrible fine scent coming out of they.</USER><BOT>Put them into the nosegay, John - And now - no more - Tis enough waste for one day.</BOT>
<USER>I dont think twas of beans that I did hear.</USER><BOT>Or that twas his spotted hilt what fetched the highest price of any in the market Saturday?</BOT>
<USER>O Miss Jessie.</USER><BOT>Hark you here, my girl - if twasnt hay time you should bundle up your rags and off with you this minute.  But as tis awkward being short of a pair of hands just now, youll bide a week or two and then youll get outside of my door with no more character to you nor what I took you with.</BOT>
<USER>Well, now - to think of such a thing.  Indeed!</USER><BOT>Ive seen a horse right up to the neck of him in that old quag ahind of our place - a-snorting and a-clapping with his teeth and a-plunging so as twould terrify anyone to harken to it.  And thats how tis to-day with Master William up at home, so tis.</BOT>
<USER>Well, and what do you want me to do or to say now, Joan?</USER><BOT>See here, mistress, I want you to give me a chance.  Theyll never stoop to wed me if they knows as Im but a poor serving maid.</BOT>
<USER>Well make a grand fine lady of you there, Rose.</USER><BOT>Am I not one in looks already, Robert?</BOT>
<USER>I cant help that, master.  Foolish deeds do call for foolish words, may be.</USER><BOT>My pretty Miss is almost fainting, I declare.    Put the drunken fellow outside and lets have an end of this.</BOT>
<USER>To the lady what my masters a-courting of, mistress.</USER><BOT>And whom may that be, John?</BOT>
<USER>Susan is the maids name.</USER><BOT>I dont want none of your laces or silks.</BOT>
<USER>Tis not.  There are some wenches who dont know how to leave anyone alone.  Worser than cattle flies, that sort.</USER><BOT>O you shame me by them words, I baint that sort of maid - youll answer for me - William?</BOT>
<USER>Ill soon better that.</USER><BOT>Be you a-going in them fine buckled shoes, master?</BOT>
<USER>Twill very likely be the same with Julia.  Go and bring her quickly, John.</USER><BOT>As you will, master - but Susan have been wonderful nasty in her ways with me of late.  Tis my belief as she have took up with one of they low gipsy lads what have been tenting up yonder, against the wood.</BOT>
<USER>I should have thought as how a grand young mistress like yourself might have had the days to your own liking.</USER><BOT>Ah, and so I did once.  But that was before Uncle died and left me the farm.  Now, tis all different with the days.</BOT>
<USER>Nor me neither, master.  Never heared nor seed such a thing.  But mistress, her says, you cant sit a maid from town at table unless there be poultry afore of she.  They be rare nesh in their feeding, maids from town, so mistress do say.</USER><BOT>That just brings us to our little matter, George.  When is it that you expect the young lady?</BOT>
<USER>Tis Laura, William.</USER><BOT>Folks did tell me that you were named Julia.</BOT>
<USER>Now, you mark my words, twill be sommat as I shall want to fling over the hedge for all the use twill be.</USER><BOT>My mistress thought it might be suitable.</BOT>
<USER>Taint to be expected as I shall let a dirty tramp bide in my kitchen when tis all cleaned up against to-morrow, Steve.</USER><BOT>To-morrow, tis my day, Mother, and Ill have the choosing of my guests, like.    Come you in out of the cold.  This night you shall bide fed and warmed, so that, may be, in years to come, twill please you to think back upon the eve afore my wedding.</BOT>
<USER>I wish he was a goat-herd like myself - O that I do.</USER><BOT>Then there wouldnt be no use in your wedding yourself with him as I can see.</BOT>
<USER>Im not going to believe a word the young person says.</USER><BOT>She has told you but the truth, my good friends.</BOT>
<USER>If you go careful and dont drop it in the snow may be as Ill wrap my big shawl around of you, Dorry, whats hanging behind the door.</USER><BOT>Give me my cloak, Steve - O, how I do love a bit of dancing, dont you, Mr. Davis?</BOT>
<USER>Let us go quickly then.</USER><BOT>End of Act I.</BOT>
<USER>I guess twas sommat like that, Andrew.</USER><BOT>O May, you have gladdened me powerful by these words.</BOT>
<USER>And a rare basket of green stuff that you have been getting.</USER><BOT>His dear gift to me!</BOT>
<USER>I shall be deaf before Ive done, but it appears to me that Annets not lost any time in making the most of her chances.</USER><BOT>Ah, and she be none the worse for that.  Tis what we all likes to do.  Whered I be in the market if I did let my chances blow by me?  Hear that, Andrew?</BOT>
<USER>Couldnt better it at the Kings Head up our way.</USER><BOT>Good drink - plenty of it.  Now well start upon the meat I reckon.</BOT>
<USER>But I mean it.  Do let me help a little.</USER><BOT>See them taters?</BOT>
<USER>What about that bit of blue ribbon, George?</USER><BOT>Yes, Thomas.  Ask Georgie if he will give it back to me.</BOT>
<USER>Try to get out your story - you can let the tears run afterwards if you have a mind.</USER><BOT>There comed a day when I did meet a fisherman from Bristol.  He brought me news of Robert back from the seas, clothed in fine stuff with money in the pockets of him, horse and carriage, and just about to wed.</BOT>
<USER>No, from the roadside.</USER><BOT>Worser far.</BOT>
<USER>And so theres going to be a wedding here to-day?</USER><BOT>Tis my Dad as is to be married.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Not a bit of it.  Recollect, your fancy has been set on her since Sunday.</USER><BOT>Come, Mother, you cant expect a man to jump into the river all of a sudden like this.</BOT>
<USER>Then stretch it.</USER><BOT>Twould be like putting a wild bird into a gilded cage, to set me here in this place.  No, I must go free with you, Chris - and we will wander where our spirits lead us - over all the world if we have a mind to do so.</BOT>
<USER>Come, show them all, Rose.</USER><BOT>There tis, then.</BOT>
<USER>Id like to see the flower garden now, where this nosegay came from.</USER><BOT>I dont know what the folks would say if they were to see you and me a-going on the road in broad day - Im sure I dont.</BOT>
<USER>It is dusk on the same evening.</USER><BOT>ANNET sits watching her, on her knees lies a open parcel disclosing a woollen shawl.  In a far corner of the room MAY is seated on a stool making a daisy chain.</BOT>
<USER>Do you know what Maggies crying for, Aunt Clara?</USER><BOT>Im sure I dont, little boy.</BOT>
<USER>Ah - Twas that I did hear tell of.  Now I remember it.</USER><BOT>But Master William - the tongue what he do keep be smooth as honey, and a lady might do as she likes with him if one got the chance.</BOT>
<USER>Thats good hearing, master.  And is the victuals like to be as fine as the place?</USER><BOT>O, youll fare well enough yonder.</BOT>
<USER>Them questions will have to bide till another time, I reckon.  Im got late already, master.</USER><BOT>Arriving by the morning coach!  I shall certainly make my call to the farm before sunset.  What do you say, Jenner?</BOT>
<USER>Youll bide here, Annie, and tis more gladness than I can rightly think on, that tis.</USER><BOT>Steve!</BOT>
<USER>O, this is quite a little picture!  See how the leaves do curl backwards - so fresh and green!</USER><BOT>Ah, and that one has a rare white heart to it, it has.</BOT>
<USER>Now why do you say such a thing?</USER><BOT>Twas in these rags as I danced in the wood that day, and tis by these rags as my lord will know me once more.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats it, and Ill go along of she and help draw the cider.  Courtship be powerful drying work.</USER><BOT>O William, twas those Early Snowballs that did first stir up my heart.</BOT>
<USER>Do you listen to that, Jerry!  The ladies here do find you pleasant and homely, and I dont know what else.</USER><BOT>The mugs want filling once more.</BOT>
<USER>Come, tell me all.</USER><BOT>And whilst I was sat down upon that fallen tree, and sort of pretending to myself, the two gentlemen came along.</BOT>
<USER>Like you, George.</USER><BOT>What I was saying is - Tis the first time as you have been set afore a bowl of taters like this.</BOT>
<USER>Now shes off again!  Come, sit you down, Vashti Reed, and Ill give you summat asll very likely warm you and keep you quiet in your chair a while.  Just you wait till I gets the water boiling.</USER><BOT>Heres Miss Sims coming up the path, and Rosie too.  O, theyre wrapped up all over cause tis snowing.  Ill open, Ill open.</BOT>
<USER>Ive gone from the place where I was servant.</USER><BOT>Then youll come along of me - the both of you.</BOT>
<USER>That us will.  What if us stayed at home and helped to mind the house along of he?</USER><BOT>And did not put our new gowns upon the backs of we after all the money spent?</BOT>
<USER>Your heart, Andrew?  Twill go all the better afterwards if tis tossed about a bit first.</USER><BOT>Put an end to this foolishness, Mill, and say when youll wed me.</BOT>
<USER>From Simons Pool, George?</USER><BOT>I count her must have went across the plank afore twas fairly daylight.  And, being slippery, like, from the snow, and her - her - as you did say.</BOT>
<USER>The wench what his lordship did see a-dancing all by herself in the forest when he was hid one day all among the brambles, a-rabbiting or sommat.</USER><BOT>And when my lord would have spoke with her, the maid did turn and fled away quick as a weasel.</BOT>
<USER>But there, you neednt look downhearted, master, for I knows someone asll give you a rare warm welcome if so be as you should change your mind and take your chance in the open, same as we.</USER><BOT>You shall pay for that, Chris.</BOT>
<USER>Nay, nay, twas my doing, Emily.  I did tell the wenches as they might sit their-selves along of we, just for th occasion like.</USER><BOT>And who are you, if you please, giving orders and muddling about like a lord in my kitchen?</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  O you put me out of all patience, William.  Wheres the rent to come from if we go on like this?  And the clothing, and the food?  And Johns wages, and your flower seeds, if it comes to that, for you have got terrible wasteful over the flowers.</USER><BOT>I wish youd take it quieter, Mother.  Look at you bed of musk, tis a grand smell that comes up from it all around.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, I reckon as youll not let them bide till they does.</USER><BOT>And when they do know, and when they sees who tis, I count as theyll be good to me, I count they will.  I did used to think as Steve, he was a hard one, and th old woman whats his mother, hard too - And that it did please him for to keep a rein on me like, but I sees thing different now.</BOT>
<USER>All for to hear the small birds sing</USER><BOT>And the lambs to skip and play.</BOT>
<USER>O, let me open the door - let me open it!</USER><BOT>Im going to the dance, Mr. Davis.  Look, havent I got a nice frock on?</BOT>
<USER>Own to everything now, and lose all just as my hand was closing upon it, like!</USER><BOT>Poor Joan, it will not make any difference in the end, if the man loves you truly.</BOT>
<USER>Come, come, Luke Jenner, youve been and kept us waiting more nor half an hour.  Cant you sit yourself down and give other folk a chance of eating their victuals quiet?  Theres naught to make all this giddle-gaddle about as I can see.</USER><BOT>Beg pardon, mistress, I know Im a bit late.  But the victuals as are waited for do have a better flavour to them nor those which be ate straight from the pot like.</BOT>
<USER>Twasnt me as found the ribbon.</USER><BOT>Who was it then?</BOT>
<USER>Tis Father at a little bit of carpentering.</USER><BOT>Im come too soon, I reckon.</BOT>
<USER>I dont believe in such signs, myself.</USER><BOT>I never knowed it not come true.</BOT>
<USER>It was as much my fault as hers, Mister Jenner.  There were things that each of us wanted, and that we thought we might get, by changing places, one with the other.</USER><BOT>give me a higher</BOT>
<USER>Twas Annet.</USER><BOT>What was?</BOT>
<USER>JOAN, maid to Clara.</USER><BOT>MILES HOOPER, a rich draper.</BOT>
<USER>And here you be comed back, and there lie the gold and the silver bags.</USER><BOT>And yonder is Millie given in marriage to another.</BOT>
<USER>Tis all one to me whether you does or you does not.</USER><BOT>Now, John, you are angry with me still.</BOT>
<USER>All I say is that I hope he may get it then.</USER><BOT>Ah, I reckon as tis rare put about as he have been all this long while, and never a downright yes to what he do ask.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, herll have got tother old baggage set in the right place by then.</USER><BOT>what now</BOT>
<USER>They may stir within you like an old waspes nest for all I care, John.</USER><BOT>Come, Susan, put better words to your tongue nor they.  You can speak honey sweet when it do please you to.</BOT>
<USER>And Jerry had to do the hooking for we, both of the servants having runned away.</USER><BOT>Well, now Im here Ill lend a hand.  Ill help with the dinner time youre at church.  You shall not need to trouble about anything, Mr. John.</BOT>
<USER>What for, mistress?</USER><BOT>no i am not. she was waiting for me</BOT>
<USER>Granma, isnt Miss Sims nice-looking, dont you think?  Id like to wear my hair like hers and have earrings a-hanging from me and a-shaking when I moves my head, I would.</USER><BOT>Here, fetch me the matches, do.</BOT>
<USER>What will Aunt Clara be thinking of then, Dad?</USER><BOT>Herll remember, very like, how twas when her left - some fourteen year ago.  And herll have her eyes on Granmas chair, whats empty.</BOT>
<USER>O mistress, youll never guess what Ive been and done.  But twasnt all my fault at the commencement.</USER><BOT>You do look very disturbed, Joan, what has happened?</BOT>
<USER>O mistress, you dont mean to say as his lordship have followed us down already.</USER><BOT>His lordship!  As if I should be stirred by him!</BOT>
<USER>EMILY, his wife, the same age.</USER><BOT>CLARA, his sister, aged 21.</BOT>
<USER>Not so, not so, Joan.  That might betray you.</USER><BOT>What, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>But he hasnt set out yet, John.</USER><BOT>You take and hold the nosegay, mistress, and Ill go straight off and fetch him, so being as youre agreeable.</BOT>
<USER>Heres someone whats missed their way, I count.</USER><BOT>Why, tis like the poor thing we seed beneath the hedge, I do believe.</BOT>
<USER>Mores the pity, Master Thomas.</USER><BOT>Ah, I often thinks of how it might have been - with her and me, like.</BOT>
<USER>Why, Joan, what has happened?</USER><BOT>All has happened.  But stop him going to the farmer to talk about the - the wedding and the money.</BOT>
<USER>Play acting there never has been in my house, George, Id like for you to know.</USER><BOT>O yes there have been, mistress.  And tis time it was finished.    You just take and ask that young person what she do mean by tricking herself out in Miss Claras gowns and what not, and by having herself called by Miss Claras own name.</BOT>
<USER>Dear me, what a gathering to be sure.</USER><BOT>Indeed it is an unusual sight.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a pretty caddle, thats all.</USER><BOT>The mistress isnt took ill? or Miss Kitty?</BOT>
<USER>That will suit us best, Im sure.  Come, sister.</USER><BOT>Ill just step outside and see that Jerrys tending to the horse.</BOT>
<USER>Millie, whats the good of we two going on to church one with tother?</USER><BOT>Theres no good at all, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>Give I the watering can.</USER><BOT>Here it is, dear John.  O I had a fancy all the time that twas to Laura your master had lost his heart.  And now I see I made no mistake.</BOT>
<USER>O cursed seeds of love - Far better to have left all as twas yesterday in the morning.</USER><BOT>He has followed me like my shadow, courting and courting me hard and all the time, Lubin.</BOT>
<USER>Now, John, do you look into my eyes and tell me if tis for love of Julia or of Laura that your master lies sickening.</USER><BOT>Youd best go and ask it of his self, mistress.  Tis a smartish lot of work as Ive got to attend to here.</BOT>
<USER>And now, John, when the nosegays all gathered and the flowers bunched, what else should I do?</USER><BOT>Well, then you gives it her when you gets to the door.  And very like shell ask you into the parlour, seeing as you be a particular fine looking gentleman.</BOT>
<USER>Twill be put by with the silk dress.  So there.  Tis not a suitable thing for a little girl like you.</USER><BOT>No one shant take my book from me.  There be pictures of great horses and sheep and cows in it - and no one shant hide it from me.</BOT>
<USER>Im a poor ragged thing to be daughter to the likes of she.  But the heart within of me is grander nor that of any queen, because of the love that it holds for you, my lord.</USER><BOT>We will be married to-morrow, my princess.  And all these good people shall dance at our wedding.</BOT>
<USER>Warm, I should think it was warm in under of that great white curtain.</USER><BOT>Aunt Clara, Im Jessie.</BOT>
<USER>There youre mistook.  Th idle wench and the lad be both away - off afore dawn to the Fair and took their clothes along of they.  I be left with all upon me like, and tis too much.</USER><BOT>What shall you do, Jerry?</BOT>
<USER>How you do go on, to be sure!  Why dont you speak of summat whats got some sense to it?  Come, dont you know as Steve, his wedding day, tis to-morrow as ever is.</USER><BOT>Tis the New Year, too, Granny, as well as Dads marriage.</BOT>
<USER>Tis your mistress, since you wants to know.</USER><BOT>O, I see it all now - How could I have been so misled!</BOT>
<USER>What be you a-telling I of?</USER><BOT>We was saying, how be you in this sharp weather, Mrs. Reed?</BOT>
<USER>I was just the maid as ever I was until -</USER><BOT>And so was I unchanged, until I started travelling up on the same road as you, Isabel.</BOT>
<USER>Im going to look at your book along of you, Robin.</USER><BOT>But Im the one to turn the leaves, remember.  [The children sit side by side looking at the picture book.  CLARA sews.  GEORGE goes on with the potatoes.  As the last one is finished and tossed into the water, he looks at CLARA for the first time.  A long silence.</BOT>
<USER>What did you tell me, John?</USER><BOT>That, let her abide and herd find the senses of she presently.</BOT>
<USER>Ill have no cider drinking out of meal times here.</USER><BOT>Then twill I have to be when we come back from church.</BOT>
<USER>Im sure Im very much obliged to you, Miles.</USER><BOT>Thats all right, Luke.</BOT>
<USER>Dads been a rare long time a-cleaning of his self up, Gran.</USER><BOT>Will you bide still!  Howevers this frock to get fastened and you moving this way and that like some live eel - and just see what a mark youve made on the elbow last night, putting your arm down somewhere where you didnt ought to - I might just as well have never washed the thing.</BOT>
<USER>The same wood.</USER><BOT>WILLIAM carries a large market basket containing vegetables.</BOT>
<USER>Tis one who would never look upon me with thoughts of love if I went to him as I am now, Joan.</USER><BOT>I cant rightly understand you, mam.</BOT>
<USER>You mustnt take no account of Mother when she speaks so sharp.  Tis only her way.</USER><BOT>Could you come and be our serving maid when Maggies sent off?</BOT>
<USER>Steve Browning?</USER><BOT>I havent patience with th old gipsy!  Yes - Steve.  And tis a twelvemonth or more as youd knowed of it.</BOT>
<USER>Id sooner be about and on my way, Missis, if tis all the same to you.  But I thanks you kindly.  And you get and tell May when she do come home, that tis particular glad I be for to know as her baint took worse, nor nothing.  And should I happen in these parts again, tis very likely as Ill take a look in on she some day.</USER><BOT>Ah, herll have got tother old baggage set in the right place by then.</BOT>
<USER>New days, new ways, John.</USER><BOT>Bless my soul, but tis hard to keep up with all these goings on, and no mistake.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, master be used to them great palaces, all over gold and marble with windows as you might drive a waggon through, and that you might.</USER><BOT>All painted glass.  And each chair with golden legs to him, and a sight of silver vessels on the table as never you did dream of after a nights drinking, old man.  [GILES comes slowly towards them.</BOT>
<USER>I thought to find something which was mine when I was a little child, but which I lost.</USER><BOT>O Georgie do know how to find things which is lost.  Twas he as brought back the yellow pullet when her had strayed off.</BOT>
<USER>You may not be partial to pig meat, mistress, but youll send back the key of Master Williams heart same as you have done the jowls.</USER><BOT>I have no use for the key of Master Williams heart either, John.  And you may tell him so, from me.</BOT>
<USER>I believe twas in Church on Sunday that I chanced to take notice of you, like.</USER><BOT>Yes, but what was it about me that took your fancy in Church on Sunday?</BOT>
<USER>It is a morning in June.</USER><BOT>On reaching a fallen tree he sits down on it, placing his basket on the ground.  With his stick he absently moves the grass and leaves that lie before him, and is so deeply lost in his own thoughts that he does not hear the approach of MILES and LUKE until they are by his side.</BOT>
<USER>Then what do you up yonder at the marrying this morning?</USER><BOT>Oh, I do take me to those places where there be burying or marriage, for the hearts of folk at these seasons be warmed and kinder, like.  And tis bread and meat as I gets then.  Food be thrown out to the poor old dog what waits patient at the door.</BOT>
<USER>Maggie, Maggie, where are you, you great lazy-boned donkey?</USER><BOT>Did you call me, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>I cant abide for you to go.  Tis more nor I can stand.  Why, if you goes, May, tis tother wench and th old woman whatll get mistressing it here again in your place.    No - you shant go.  Ill holler till Ive waked them every one - you shant!  My only child, my pretty May!  Ah, tis not likely as you shall slip off again.  Tis not.</USER><BOT>Look you here, Mother - bide still, I say.    See here - tis rare dry as I be.  You bide quiet and usll have a drink together, that us will.  Look, th old womans forgot to put away the bottle, usll wet our mouths nice and quiet, mother - she wont hear I taking out the cork, nor nothing.  See!</BOT>
<USER>A slow sowing and a quick reaping, John.</USER><BOT>Tis to be hoped as twill be the same with the lady, master.</BOT>
<USER>O, Granny, Ill be a-feared to go across the garden after dark, I shall.</USER><BOT>What do you want to go and put that there into the childs head for?  Id like for Steve to hear you talking of such stuff.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, we find the mansions in town very different to a country farm house, dont we Miss?</USER><BOT>I should think we did, Mister Hooper.  Why, look at that great old wooden chair by the hearth?  Dont it look un-stylish, upon my word, with no cushions to it nor nothing.</BOT>
<USER>I told him not to shew hisself unless he could bring a couple of servants back along with him.</USER><BOT>Youre more foolish than I took you to be, John.  Get you off at once and fetch Jerry from his cider at the Red Bull.  Hes not much of a hand about the house, but hes better than no one.</BOT>
<USER>What, the one with the white stones to it?</USER><BOT>Yes, grandmothers ring, that she left me.  And I did say to him - if ever I do turn false to you and am like to wed another, Giles - look you at these white stones.</BOT>
<USER>And as I was laid beneath the hedge - Tis cold as my limbs is, now, I says, but I shall be warm this night.  And the pangs what was in the body of me did fairly quail I - Tis my fill of victuals as I shall soon put within, thinks I.  And they was laid a bit.  The bleakness of the tempest fell on I, but I shant feel lonesome no longer than this hour, I telled me.  For to my thinking, Steve, he was waiting all the time till I should be comed back.  And Dorry, too.  There tis.  [A long silence.</USER><BOT>Id have been content to bide with the door shut - so long as it was shut with they two and me inside the room - th old woman - well, I count I shouldnt have took many thought for she - she could have bided in her place if shed had a mind - Id have set me down, when once my clothes was decent and clean, and put my hands to the work and made a tidy wife for Steve, as good nor better than that there dressed-up thing out yonder - And bred Dorry up the right way, too, I would.  But tis done with now, so tis.</BOT>
<USER>My good friends, what is it that you carry in those bundles there?</USER><BOT>Tis gold in mine.</BOT>
<USER>Well, you can tell your master Im not one that can be courted with a jowl, mellow or otherwise.  And that Ill not wed until I can give my heart along with my hand.</USER><BOT>Id like to know where you would find a better one nor master for to give your heart to, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>And that I do, John.</USER><BOT>Well, you may go and sit within it till the master has leisure to come and speak with you.</BOT>
<USER>Will you dance for me again, Susan?</USER><BOT>Princess Royal is her name.</BOT>
<USER>The same to you, master.</USER><BOT>Folks do call me John.</BOT>
<USER>And yet, look you here, you be brought down terrible low, May.</USER><BOT>The fine looks of a woman be as grass, Harry, and in the heat of the day they do wither and die.  And that what has once been a grand flower in the hand of a man is dropped upon the ground and spat upon, maybe.  So twas with I.</BOT>
<USER>Ill take you along to it then.  [He gives her his arm, very awkwardly, and they move away.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.    Well - things have changed since I was young.</BOT>
<USER>Now do you come in, mister, and have a bit of talk along of we.</USER><BOT>Set down them pails and do as sister says, Mister Jeremy.</BOT>
<USER>It will never bring happiness to me, Chris.</USER><BOT>Come, mistress, tis a fine thing to have a great stone roof above the head of you.</BOT>
<USER>Maybe then, as themll not know as tis me, Harry Moss.</USER><BOT>I count as theyll be hard put to, and thats the truth.</BOT>
<USER>Only a drink of water, master?  Then take, and be comforted.</USER><BOT>Master, from whom did you get this?</BOT>
<USER>Father, hes outside, and Jim and Bill and Katie, and all the rest.  We said as twould be pleasanter if we was all to go up together along to the church.</USER><BOT>So twould be - so twould be - Twas a grand thought of yourn, Rosie.</BOT>
<USER>I count twill all be well with you now, May?</USER><BOT>I warrant as twill, for I be right to home.  But go you towards the town, Harry, for tis late.  And God go with you, my dear, now and all time.</BOT>
<USER>And what was that, I wonder?</USER><BOT>I want my pretty Miss to take the name of Hooper.  Will she oblige her Miles?</BOT>
<USER>O John, John - do you quiet down Rose and tell her to get upstairs and dress.  Shes a-saying that she wont marry Robert because of his goings on with the new servant - But, O, youll talk her into reason again, wont you, dear John?</USER><BOT>Come, come, whats all this cackle about, Rose?</BOT>
<USER>Get along off, you tiresome child. - One word might do for some, but it takes twenty to get you to move. - Run along now, do you hear me?</USER><BOT>So now its your turn.</BOT>
<USER>Upon my word, if tother wasnt the worst of the two, for she did put a powerful lot of venom into the looks as she did give I, and the words did fall from she like so many bricks on my head.</USER><BOT>Pity the first was not the right maid.</BOT>
<USER>And tis my wedding day.  He shall not go uncomforted from here.</USER><BOT>I never knowed you so careful of a poor wretch afore, Millie.  Tis quite a new set out, this.</BOT>
<USER>Whatll it be for me when Robert comes in?</USER><BOT>Well have to help one another, Isabel, in the plight where we stand.</BOT>
<USER>I dont see no gowns nor hats, and thats the truth.  But I sees summat whats like - whats like a meadow of grass in springtime afore the suns got on to it.</USER><BOT>Why, Dad, tis white, not green, as Miss Sims is wearing.</BOT>
<USER>Then you know how tis done?</USER><BOT>Ah, that I does, master.</BOT>
<USER>Id let it alone, master, if I was you.  They be all alike, the maids.  And twouldnt be amiss if we was to serve they as we serves the snails when they gets to the young plants.</USER><BOT>Please master, please mistress.</BOT>
<USER>See, Granny, Ive been and put it on for to show you better.  See the lace?  Isnt it nice?  And the beads, too.  I didnt stop for to put on my shoes, nor my new stockings.  Nor my hat, whats got a great long feather all round of it.</USER><BOT>You bad, naughty girl, Dorry, youll crease and tumble that frock so as its not fit to be seen to-morrow!  Whatever did you go to put it on for?</BOT>
<USER>Ill book you!  What next?</USER><BOT>Poor Georgie.  He was not courting Joan, mother.  He was only doing the taters for her.</BOT>
<USER>It might be the blackcap a-warbling all among of the branches.  So it might.</USER><BOT>Ah, twas I that was a-dancing in the shade of the woods that day.</BOT>
<USER>This be going a bit too far, missis.  Ill not have things said like that.</USER><BOT>Then you may turn out on to the roads where you were took from - a grizzling little roadsters varmint.  You do cost moren what you eats nor what we get of work from out of your body, you great hulk.</BOT>
<USER>Tis very hard to say, Andrew.</USER><BOT>Look you, Mill, tis more than a five year that Ive been a-courting of you faithful.</BOT>
<USER>Twas not one, but many things.  And if you wants a clear proof  - put back the laces of your sleeve, Miss Clara.</USER><BOT>What for, George?</BOT>
<USER>I know she has, Robin.</USER><BOT>Dont let me catch you speaking to Master Spring as though you and he was of the same station, young person.</BOT>
<USER>No one is thinking of me!  Whos going to help me on with my gown and curl my hair like Robert was used to seeing me wear it at Aunts?</USER><BOT>Did you have it different down at Bristol, Rose?</BOT>
<USER>Very nicely, Joan.  So nicely that if you like, you may keep them upon you for the remainder of the way.</USER><BOT>O mistress, may I really do so?</BOT>
<USER>She has altered powerful, to my fancy, in these years.</USER><BOT>And Robert be differenter too from what I do remember.  [A long silence.</BOT>
<USER>Give him something quick, Aunt, and let him get off so that we can start for the wedding.</USER><BOT>What is it I can do for you, master?</BOT>
<USER>I wouldnt much care to be upon the road to-night, would you, Steve?</USER><BOT>And at that hour when th old year be passing out, and dark on all the land, the graves shall open and give up the dead which be in they.  And, standing in the churchyard you may read the face to each, as the corpses do go by.  Theres many a night as I have stood and have looked into they when them did draw near to I, but never the face I did seek.</BOT>
<USER>Then let me bide so.  Tis all I ask.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  No, William.  Im got to be an old woman now, and tis time that I had someone at my side to help in the house-keeping and to share the work.</BOT>
<USER>O, and couldnt I be called like the last one too?</USER><BOT>Then usll call you Lucy.  And a rare bad slut her was, and doubtless youll not prove much worser.</BOT>
<USER>I shall be proud to go bare too, so long as I am by his side, May.</USER><BOT>Whats that for, Giles?</BOT>
<USER>And that ones Jerry, I suppose.</USER><BOT>Youre right there, Kitty, that you are.  A harder head was never given to man than what Jerry do carry twixt his shoulders.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, thats so, it is.  You go as you be clothed now, master.  I know what maids be, and tis finery and good coats which do work more on the hearts of they nor anything else in the wide world.</USER><BOT>No, no, my lads.  I will return as I did go from yonder.  Poor, and in mean clothing.  Nor shall a glint of all my wealth speak one word for me.  But if so be as her heart is true in spite of everything, my sorrowful garments will not hide my love away from her.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis so with she.  She baint no tame mouse what creeps from its hole along of tothers and who do go shuffle shuffle, in and out of the ring, mild as milk and naught in the innards of they but the squeak.</USER><BOT>Twas my dance gained his lordships praise - so there, fine madam.</BOT>
<USER>CHRIS, NAT and TANSIE are seated near her on the ground.</USER><BOT>I wish this day might last for always.</BOT>
<USER>I reckon I can go off and feed the hilts now.  Tis the time.</USER><BOT>Feed the hilts!  Indeed you cant do no such thing.  O Im mad with vexation that nothing is well ordered or suitably prepared for Mr. Robert and his fine cousins from Bristol town.  Whatever will they say to such a house when they do see it?</BOT>
<USER>Well, then you gives it her when you gets to the door.  And very like shell ask you into the parlour, seeing as you be a particular fine looking gentleman.</USER><BOT>bla bla bla</BOT>
<USER>A square of moonlight falls on the floor from the window.  VASHTI still sleeps in the chimney corner.  MAY is rocking herself to and fro on the settle.</USER><BOT>Get off to your drunken sleep and to your dreams!  Your dreams - your dreams - Ah, where is it as they have gone, Id like for to know.  The dreams as comed to I when I was laid beneath the hedge.  Dreams!</BOT>
<USER>I - I - dont think as I do rightly know who tis, mistress.</USER><BOT>Why, look you, Susan, youll have to take and hide yourself if you dont want for them to know as you be got along of we.</BOT>
<USER>You can say your fill.  There baint no one but me in the garden.</USER><BOT>John, you told me that since Sunday your master has been sick with love.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a beautiful turnip.</USER><BOT>You may as well have them too.</BOT>
<USER>Youre a rare tricksy maid as ever I did see.  Tricksy and tossy too.</USER><BOT>There - thats enough, John.  Suppose you set off home and tell your master he can hang up his meat again in the larder, for all that it concerns me.</BOT>
<USER>That it is, Chris.  There never was so fine a day.  And we have come to spend all of it in this forest.</USER><BOT>Ah, but tis warm upon the high road.</BOT>
<USER>O, I did - that I did.  [A short silence.</USER><BOT>And could you forget the prick of the thorn, did you hold the rose again, Laura?</BOT>
<USER>I shall go by the side of my husband by then, very likely.</USER><BOT>Your husband?  What tales be you a-giving out now?</BOT>
<USER>Not till I have the truth from you.</USER><BOT>Well then, is it likely that my master would set his fancy on such a plaguy, wayward maid?  Why, Master William do know better nor to do such a thing, I can tell you.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a well-sounding name, and one as runs easy as clear water upon the tongue.</USER><BOT>Tansie, how will it be for me to go with you?</BOT>
<USER>Why, John, twasnt your fault that the lady wouldnt take me, you did your best with her, I know.</USER><BOT>An that I did, Master William, but a more contrary coxsy sort of a maid I never did see.  I baint one as fancies pig meat, her did say.  And the nose of she did curl away up till it could go no higher.  Thats not the wench for me, I says to myself.</BOT>
<USER>Gold?  O yes - an apron full of gold, and silver too.</USER><BOT>Do you hear that, Susan?</BOT>
<USER>Well, then you gives it her when you gets to the door.  And very like shell ask you into the parlour, seeing as you be a particular fine looking gentleman.</USER><BOT>thanks for the compliment</BOT>
<USER>Tis naught, Annie, naught.  Twas summat of past times what comed into the thoughts of me.  But tis naught.  And, Rose, if so be as twas you as George is after, Id wish him to have luck, with all my heart, I would, for George and me - well, we too has always stuck close one to tother, as you knows.</USER><BOT>Ah - that you has, George and you - you and George.</BOT>
<USER>Tis in honour of Miss Claras going to be married like, master.</USER><BOT>So tis, so tis.  Well - A single rose upon the bush.  Bound to be plucked, you know.  Couldnt be left to fade in the sun, eh, girls?</BOT>
<USER>Youre right there, master.</USER><BOT>I warrant as you be journeying towards the same place where I be going, my lord.</BOT>
<USER>Thank you, my good woman.  Next time you want to play a little prank like this, I beg that you will select your partner with more care.  The name of Hooper is not a suitable one to toy with, let me tell you.</USER><BOT>Arent you going to marry her then, Mister Hooper?</BOT>
<USER>Yes twas.  The maid so put me powerful in mind of someone who - who -</USER><BOT>I understand you, Robert.  Well, tis lucky that all this didnt come off an hour or so later.</BOT>
<USER>We cant find no one in this house to attend upon we.</USER><BOT>I count as you can not.  Baint no one here.</BOT>
<USER>You should have had a cloak like mine, Annet, by rights.</USER><BOT>Im not going to get married, Millie.</BOT>
<USER>Whose gown, master?  Ill warrant twasnt missuss.</USER><BOT>Bless my soul, no.  No, no, George.  Twasnt the mistress then.</BOT>
<USER>The shows of acting folk, and the wild animals, and the nice sweets.</USER><BOT>They dont want to hear about anything sensible, Dan.  Theyre like all the maids now, with their thoughts set on pleasuring and foolishness.</BOT>
<USER>But in the clothing of us, Mill - why, tis a grand young lady that you look - whilst I -</USER><BOT>Here - put this over your gown, Annet.</BOT>
<USER>See these young carrots, mistress.</USER><BOT>Indeed I do, master.</BOT>
<USER>Good-morning to you, mistress.</USER><BOT>Good-morning, Andrew.</BOT>
<USER>Well, John, it appears that Im to pass out of my own keeping.  My Sunday clothes are all laid out upon the bed.</USER><BOT>Bless my soul, Master William, and tis but Thursday too.</BOT>
<USER>No mistress could speak harshly to you, Susan - you are so young and pretty.</USER><BOT>Ah, but mistress takes no account of aught but the work you does, and the tongue of her be wonderful lashing.</BOT>
<USER>Please to remove your bonnet, Miss Eliza.  Please to remove yours, Miss Jane.</USER><BOT>Ah, thats so - Twill be more homely like for eating.</BOT>
<USER>Look here, my wench, I be master in my own house, and at the asking in marriage of my only sister like, tis me as shall say what shall sit down with who.  And theres an end of it.  Thats all.</USER><BOT>I hear them a coming in, master.</BOT>
<USER>O, how did you guess my - my name?</USER><BOT>Come, twasnt a hard matter, that.</BOT>
<USER>Of all the meddlesome old women - why cant her bide till hers wanted.</USER><BOT>Well, Vashti Reed, and what brings you down from the hill to-day?  Twould have been better had you bid at home, with the dark coming on and the snow.</BOT>
<USER>Well, my men.  I scarce do know whether I be a-standing on my head or upon my heels, and thats the truth tis.</USER><BOT>Ah, and that I can well understand, master, for Im a married man myself, and my woman has a tongue to her head very similar to that of th old missis yonder - so I know what tis.</BOT>
<USER>Poor old woman, tis a sad thing when folks do come to such a pass as she.</USER><BOT>And hant got their proper sense to them, nor nothing.  But shes better off nor a poor creature what we saw crouching below the hedge as we was coming across the meadow.  Why, I says to Annie, it must be bad to have no home to bide in such a night as this!  Isnt that so, Mrs. Browning?</BOT>
<USER>O, yes, mistress, and that I do - to tell master as you be coming along after he as fast as you can run.</USER><BOT>Well - I should not have put it in that way, but tis near enough may be.  So off, and make haste, Susan.</BOT>
<USER>O Chris, look at this fine garden - and yon arbour - see the fine house, with lace curtains to the windows of it.</USER><BOT>Ah - I sees it all very well.</BOT>
<USER>Young Andrew did help me with the choice, and tis all to be worn on this day month, my girl.</USER><BOT>Why, Father, whats to happen then?</BOT>
<USER>Well, theres Thomas, he is my brother, and Emily his wife.  Then the two children.</USER><BOT>And there was George.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, I seed the pair of them in church last Sunday.  Fine maids, the both of them, and properly suitable if you was to ask me.</USER><BOT>Tis only the one Ive got to court, John.</BOT>
<USER>Will you be good to me if I journey with you?</USER><BOT>Ah, tis not likely as Ill ever fail you, mistress.</BOT>
<USER>Im blessed if I do stir out again this day.  Why, look at the seedlings crying for water, and the nets to lay over the fruit and sommat of everything wanting to be done all around of me.  Ill not stir.</USER><BOT>GARDNER.  Heres John.  Suppose he were to make himself useful in the garden for once instead of meddling in things that are none of his business.</BOT>
<USER>Well, Master John, have you a fancy to come tenting along of we.</USER><BOT>give me a higher value</BOT>
<USER>Ah, the place and the ferry man too.</USER><BOT>Him as is there to-day, or him who was?</BOT>
<USER>That it will not.  To-day is a holiday.  To-morrows work.</USER><BOT>One day tis much the same as tother with me.</BOT>
<USER>Hark you, Mill, down you comes this moment else Ill smash the door right in, and that I will.</USER><BOT>Ah, tis a badly bred up wench is Millie, and herd have growed up very different if Id a-had the bringing up of she.  But spoiled she is and spoiled herve always been, and what could anyone look for from a filly whats been broke in by women folk!</BOT>
<USER>Twas so with me.  From beyond Oxford town I am come to hurt myself worse than ever, by one sight of the eyes that have looked so cruel false into mine.</USER><BOT>If I was to plead upon my knees to him twould do no good - poor wench of a serving maid like me.</BOT>
<USER>quit</USER><BOT>stop this program</BOT>
<USER>Please to come to your right senses, Millie.</USER><BOT>Come, Andrew, set your foot down as Ive set mine.</BOT>
<USER>Theyve come.  All of them.  And do you know that Roberts cousins are no fine ladies at all, as he said, but just two common old women dressed grand-like.</USER><BOT>That will be a sad shock to poor mistress.</BOT>
<USER>No, Miss Jessie.  My mood is not a singing mood this day.</USER><BOT>You ask him, Joan.</BOT>
<USER>Tis time she should see which way her bread was spread.</USER><BOT>Come, Jockie, come ladies - come Gran - well be off to the quiet of our own place where I can learn her ladyship the steps and capers.</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  The young person whos got Luthers farm.  Her name is Julia.</USER><BOT>Would she be the one with the cherry colour ribbons to her gown?</BOT>
<USER>She did tell I to say as she be coming along as fast as she may after Master William.</USER><BOT>No.  No.</BOT>
<USER>Well, I shouldnt have much cared for that, George.</USER><BOT>my name is not george</BOT>
<USER>Then sit down, all of you, and we will talk in the cool shade.</USER><BOT>Not here, if you please.  I am not used to such company.</BOT>
<USER>Run along and get some for your cousin, May.  [MAY runs out of the room.</USER><BOT>Come you here, Andrew, did you ever see a wench to beat ourn in looks, I say?</BOT>
<USER>There - Now all is ready for them.</USER><BOT>Come you and look at this great old bumble-dore, Joan, what have flyed in through the window.</BOT>
<USER>Tis almost more than I did reckon for when I started.</USER><BOT>Well, we mustnt think of that now.  We must hold up our spirits, you and I.</BOT>
<USER>Dont you be so set up as to think as you can, Thomas.  For a more foolish figure of a goose never was cut.  A man might tell when twas his own sister, if so be as he had his full senses upon him.</USER><BOT>Never you mind, Emily.  What I says to George is, he baint th only fox.  How now, my lad?</BOT>
<USER>Thatll bring luck, may be.</USER><BOT>The man from Daniels be coming along.</BOT>
<USER>There again.  Did you ever know the man to be so slow before.  I warrant as he have gone drinking or mischiefing down at the Spotted Cow instead of coming straight home with they chicken.</USER><BOT>Nay, nay.  George is not the lad to do a thing like that.  A quieter more well bred up lad nor George never trod in shoes.</BOT>
<USER>Thank you kindly, Missis, but I counts I hant the time for heavy feeding this morning.</USER><BOT>Twould serve she right, th old sinner, for the place to be licked up clean, against the time when her was comed back, so twould.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, tis a powerful lot of calming as Master William do require.  But you be the one for to give it him.  You just bide where you do sit now whilst I goes and fetches him, mistress.</USER><BOT>O that I will, my good, dear John.</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and twas lost on the way as we did find her, like a strayed sheep.</USER><BOT>And ours has been the privilege to bring the fair wanderer safely home.</BOT>
<USER>That he will, Im sure, when he has listened to what I have got to say to him.</USER><BOT>You do set a powerful store on what your tongue might say, but Id take and bide quiet at home if I was you and not come hunting of a nice reasonable gentleman like master, out of his very garden.</BOT>
<USER>CHARACTERS</USER><BOT>GARDNER.</BOT>
<USER>Youll see plenty of them presently.</USER><BOT>Will Aunt Clara bring the fowls along of she?</BOT>
<USER>CLARA, wearing an apron and a muslin cap on her head, sits by the kitchen table mending a lace handkerchief.  MAGGIE, who is dusting the plates on the dressers, pauses to watch her.</USER><BOT>Id sooner sweep the cow sheds out and that I would, nor have to set at such a niggly piece of sewing work as you.</BOT>
<USER>You do look at me as though I was yonder prize heifer what Master Williams so powerful set on.</USER><BOT>Ah - and tis true as you have sommat of the look of she when you stands a pawing of the ground as you be now.</BOT>
<USER>And I know it too, Millie - Why, your tongue, tis very near as sharp as when Aunt do speak.</USER><BOT>O Millie, take off these things - I cannot do it, thats the truth.</BOT>
<USER>Tis prime you looks when you be angered, Susan.  The blue fire do fairly leap from your eyes.</USER><BOT>O youre enough to anger a saint, John.  What have you brought me here for?</BOT>
<USER>And do you think as she got talking a lot to Dorry, Steve?</USER><BOT>Im blest if I do know, George.  I never gived another thought to she.  Whats up?</BOT>
<USER>GARDNER.  Those are the first suitable words that have been spoken in my hearing this afternoon.</USER><BOT>Julia, look!  The first one of the season!  O, isnt it a picture!</BOT>
<USER>Well, what next!  You might stop to consider how twill look in the parish.</USER><BOT>How what will look?</BOT>
<USER>Do tell us more of what you did see at the Fair, Uncle.</USER><BOT>There was a ram.  My word! but the four feet of he did cover a good two yards of ground; just as it might be, standing.</BOT>
<USER>O Annie, twas thoughts as was too heavy for me, and I couldnt seem to get them pushed aside, like.</USER><BOT>Howd it be if you was to tell me, Steve.</BOT>
<USER>Tis an unfailing charm.  A powder from roses, fine as dust, and another seed as well.  You put it in her glass of water - and the love comes back to you afore next sun-rise.</USER><BOT>And will it be the same with I?</BOT>
<USER>That I will, Steve.  Be you a-going to see Annie safe to home?</USER><BOT>Do you bide here, Steve, and let me run back - tis but a step - and I dont like for you to come out into the snow again.</BOT>
<USER>Tis a-smartening of hisself up for this here dancing as he be about, I reckon.</USER><BOT>Id like to go along, too, and see the dancing up at the schools to-night, I would.</BOT>
<USER>I be a-going to fetch him down, and thats what Im a-going for to do.</USER><BOT>Harken you, Steve, hes never got to know as Ive been here.</BOT>
<USER>Now do you take a good draught of this, the both of you.  With violet leaves the fever of the mind is calmed, and heartsease lightens every trouble caused by love.  Rosemary do put new life to anyone with its sweetness, and cold spring water does the rest.</USER><BOT>Baint we going to get a drink too?</BOT>
<USER>Ah, and you may tell your young madam that tis high time as she was out of bed and abroad.  Hear that?  [CLARA goes out.</USER><BOT>I like her.  She speaks so gentle.  Not like Aunt.</BOT>
<USER>Look you here - tis growing day.  I must be getting off and on to the road.</USER><BOT>i dont like you anymore</BOT>
<USER>That Ill never say, Father.  I dont want cloaks nor bonnets, nor my heart moved by gifts, or tears brought to my eyes by fair words.  Ill not wed unless I can give my love along with my hand.  And tis not to Andrew I can give that, as you know.</USER><BOT>And to whom should a maid give her heart if twasnt to Andrew?  A finer lad never trod in a pair of shoes.  Ill be blest if I do know what the wenches be a-coming to.</BOT>
<USER>Man and maid be both gone off.  Same as tothers, usll have to do without service</USER><BOT>Gone off!</BOT>
<USER>Tis plain as a turnpike what youve been after, young person.  If you was my serving wench, tis neck and crop as you should be thrown from the door.</USER><BOT>What for, mistress?</BOT>
<USER>But herll have to change her note this day, that herll have.  For Ive spoke for she, and tis for next month as Ive pitched the wedding day.</USER><BOT>And you may pitch, Father.  You may lead the mare down to the pond, but shell not drink if she hasnt the mind to.  You know what Millie is.  Tisnt from my side that she gets it either.</BOT>
<USER>O, let me see, Dad, let me look, too!</USER><BOT>Come, Mr. Davis, we must have a look, too.</BOT>
<USER>And twould be good not to go to bed with the pain of hunger within my lean old body - so twould.  [SUSAN turns round suddenly.</USER><BOT>Ill do it, Gran.  Ill do it for your sake.  Tis very likely true what you do say, all of you.  Id but dance my feet off for naught.  When he came to look into my gipsy eyes, twould all be over and done with.</BOT>
<USER>I likes doing things my own way, Mother.  Women-folk, they be so buzzing.  Tis like a lot of insects around of anyone on a summers day.  A-saying this way and that - whilst a man do go at anything quiet and calm-like.  [ANNET comes in.</USER><BOT>Please, Uncle, Millie says that she isnt coming down for no one.</BOT>

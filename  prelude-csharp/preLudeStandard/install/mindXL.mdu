<USER>Whale tale</USER><BOT>S are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000 unsuccessfully trying to free a  dubbed churchill from fishing ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 s near here a few weeks ago prompted a lump in the national throat. the "save the s" ethos is almost unquestioned, and  and  risk becoming pariahs by continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy .  but it's time to put sentiment aside. the "save the s" campaign against all commercial ing was necessary a few decades ago, after ing had devastated all large species. even today, there are fewer than 10,000 s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and s may become extinct.  but it is equally true that restrictions on ing, including a moratorium on all commercial ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some  stocks. the u.s. national  service estimated in 2000 that there are more than two million s worldwide. the international ing commission calculated years ago that there were more than 900,000 s and 780,000 s worldwide, and the numbers are higher now. milton man, a ing expert at the university of alberta, estimates that the number of s has trebled over 30 years and that  are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent annually.  indeed, the number of s (which came off the endangered species list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones began washing up on west coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed. the best guess is that the numbers of  grew, the food supply shrank and malthus had his way.  the bottom line is that while most large s remain at risk, for some species we can no longer argue that we need to "save the s." they've been saved.  at a time when there's talk about overing, it's also worth pointing out that s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as much as humans. there is speculation that rising numbers of s may be holding down the population of s that compete for similar food.</BOT>

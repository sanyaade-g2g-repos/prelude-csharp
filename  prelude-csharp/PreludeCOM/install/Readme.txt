INSTALLATION
===============================================

Well, there is nothing really to install ;-) 
Just execute the "Prelude Setup" follow the 
instructions of the installation menu and start
chatting! Thanks to Jordan Russel for his great
-free- setup wizard (Inno)

===============================================
DISTRIBUTION
===============================================

Prelude is "free/gift-ware". You are welcome to use 
it and dont have to pay for that! But you may 
consider sending me pieces of your funniest 
conversations with Prelude or you might share 
(links to) your most sophisticated memory files 
on the message board for the open public to play 
with... 

Prelude@# is based on Microsoft's .NET technology.
So in order to successfully run the program you
will need to download and install the latest Frame-
work (Framework 1.0 and higher)



IMPORTANT:

Version 0.0.0.1 is initially supplied with a *very*
rudimentary English memory file which 
you are free to use and to enlarge. This file 
(usually named "mind.mdu") will load automatically.
If you dont use the skinned version of Prelude@#
you can also load and save other *.mdu files...

Simply exchange your local mind file, which will be
found directly in Miranda's main directory called
"mind.mdu"

FILES included:
 
-Readme 
-Regasm and gacutil  (needed for registering components)
-PreludeCOM.dll      (chatbot engine)
-st.dll		     (utility)
-PreludeIM	     (the plugin itself-location: Miranda\plugins)
-mind.mdu	     (the bots brain-location: Miranda\)
-un/rprogram	     (for the un/registering of components)

===============================================
FEATURES
===============================================

PreludeIM is a chatbot like Megahal and Annabot.
Its engine is the self learning chat bot Prelude.
See the Plugins Option's Menu for configuration
details...

REVISIONS HISTORY
===============================================

- none so far, still kinda beta phaze :~)

===============================================
USAGE
===============================================

Well, if you startup your PreludeIM chat bot 
you will find it somewhat stupid and dumb -
However, do not despair! 
Although the first chats can be daring it
soon gets funnier. There are just a few "rules" 
you have to keep in mind:

	+ PRELUDE is like a child
	It will repeat a sentence, if it finds no
	answer to it. 
	Best way to teach it: Give a meaningful 
	answer to the echoing chatbot. Next time
	it will (hopefully) come up with at least 
	your supplied answer. The more detailed and
	cunning your answer the better! The bot will
	almost entirely reflect the style and register
	of your conversations with it. It will usually
	come up with better answers, if your input is
	not all too short and not all too simple.

	+ If you think, PRELUDES answer does not
	really fit your question/sentence, try to
	imagine what PRELUDE could mean with its
	output: This kind of "interpretation" is 
	necessary, for PRELUDE has (especially in
	the beginning) only a limited scale of 
	expressions. So sometimes, in order to
	match your new ideas, it will have to draw
	from another context, in order to somehow
	express its thoughts. So better be 
	imaginative!

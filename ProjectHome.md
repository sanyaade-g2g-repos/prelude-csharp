Prelude is a "self-learning", i.e. teachable chatbot, which has been developed by Lennart Lopin.

It uses a simple yet surprisingly well working approach to create chatbots, which do not depend on pre-fabricated knowledge.

Prelude learns while chatting with the user and applies a stunning algorithm to enable the Bot to chose a response he himself "thinks" appropriate.

It can be applied to any language and will quickly gain conversational skills as its memory expands. 2006 chatterbox challenge 3rd prizeIn 2005 Prelude even won the 3rd prize at the international    contest "Chatterbox Challenge" scoring high as being on of the best self-learning chatbots.

Though the work on Prelude was inspired by various self-learning chatbots like Leo it is based on a complete new approach.
